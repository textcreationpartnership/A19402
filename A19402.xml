         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

It was committed or offred vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the preſſe, and a while pawſed in the hands of the Printer of the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſitie of Oxford, as will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peare by letters likewiſe from ſome illuſtrious and learned Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors of the ſame famous Vniuerſitie. It was thence againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called home, and hath now by my ſelfe beene diuers yeares ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced vpon ſolicitation of ſome worthie Gentlemen my frends, who in the behalfe of <hi>D.

I doe therefore now iudge it full time no longer to tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, that ſo ſcandalous an imputation, as the Apologie doth impoſe vpon me falſely, ſhould ſtill in publike braue ſo impudent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly without as open and publike rebuke.

Thus much in generall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the want of reaſon in your reaſons to ſatisfie reaſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable men, for that excellency of your <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> Now let vs ſingly drawe forth your ſeverall weakneſſes in your reaſons &amp; lame poſitions a part, halting through every ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered part of your whole worke. Firſt for the vaine profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that vnlimited vniverſality in your <hi>Aurum potabile:</hi> vnderſtand that all things vniverſall are of three kinds. The firſt is vniverſall in ſubſtance, in which ſenſe no creature, but one only<note n="*" place="margin">Deus eſt prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipium vniuer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſale non de eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia vniuerſi, ſed ſupra vniuerſum Scaliger,</note> Creatour of all things can be called vniverſall. The ſecond is vniverſall in predication, and thus only <hi>Genus</hi> and <hi>Species</hi> the generall and ſpeciall kinds of all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted are called vniverſall. In this ſenſe <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> can be no more vniverſall then in the firſt, ſince it is a particular and individuall ſubſtance. The third is vniverſall in power and in the generalitie and multiplicitie of divers ends and vſes therein. In this ſenſe only <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> can be vniverſall. Now let vs ſee how farr this vniverſalitie in this vnderſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding may extend. All things that are created haue their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall ends and vſes for which they were created, and in
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:17643:8"/> thoſe ends ſome are more proper vnto one Creature, ſome vnto another. Many ends and vſes are common vnto many of them. But every one hath his owne proper<note n="*" place="margin">Natura nihil fecit<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> fruſtra Ariſtot.</note> inſeparable end and vſe vnto it ſelfe aboue and beyond all the reſt. For this cauſe Philoſophers ſay and truth doth iuſtifie, that every particular hath his owne diſtinct forme in it ſelfe by which it hath a peculiar<note n="*" place="margin">Hinc illa <gap reason="foreign">

As every thing hath his diſtinct and ſeperate forme vnto it ſelfe, ſo neceſſarily muſt it haue his ſpeciall and proper qualities, ends and<note n="*" place="margin">Forma &amp; fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nis in naturae o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peribus ſunt v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolâ differunt ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tione.</note> vſes, from thence derived vnto it ſelfe, by which it is different from all other vſes, ſince God hath created no forme<note n="*" place="margin">Nec fruſtra ac ſine cauſa quid facere dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num Deo eſt quod abhorret ab hominis conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia.

               </gap>

Vnius rei vnica forma, vnias ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tis vnus finis.</note> vſe, although therof might be made many common vſes beſides: as is inſtanced concerning the <hi>Gladius Delphicus.</hi> If this be a truth that never was nor can be denyed, then is it manifeſt and certaine that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> cannot yeeld or afford any of thoſe ſpeciall properties or vertues which God and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture haue only made and tyed appropriate vnto other ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all formes alone, be they of medicinall vſe or whatſoever els. For formes are infinite and extend as farr as <hi>Ens</hi> it ſelfe, ſince there is, nor can be no being without a forme. A neceſſary concluſion from hence doth vnavoidably and vnanſwerably iſſue that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> granted his owne peculiar vertue proper vnto his owne forme, whatſoever vertues it hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide it, it hath in common with many other medicines, and therefore cannot challenge the properties of all other vnto it ſelfe alone, nor exclude other from the participation in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with it. And hence it is alſo evident that <hi>Aurum potobile</hi> can haue no other vniverſality then is equally contingent vnto other things, creatures or medicines aſwell as vnto it ſelfe. Vnto this infallible proofe of reaſon, it is eaſie by infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite inſtances to giue illuſtration. It is cleare that in many
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:17643:9"/> common caſes <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> is droſſe and counterfeite with many vulgar things compared. In a vehement burning thirſt a cupp of ſmall beere, nay a cup of water is both more vſefull and more neceſſary. In a conſumption there are many better reſtauratiues, yea a meſſe of porrage well ordered without compariſon is more proper, and in hunger and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of nouriſhment farre more pretious. In a dangerous ſurfeit all the gold in the world reduced into whatſoever potability, ſpirit or eſſence is nothing ſo ready, ſo proſperous, ſo preſent a remedy, as any common vulgar matter, that may procure in the beginning the diſgorging of the cauſe. The like may be ſaid concerning any mortall poyſon, ſwal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed into the ſtomacke. Will any man be ſo madd as to truſt vnto the glorious vniverſality of <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> who can procure the preſent revomition of the ſubſtance of the poyſon, by any ſmall trifle procuring vomitt? In an exquiſite <hi>Synodius, Phrenſie, Peripueumonia, Augnia Plureſie,</hi> and in many innumerable other peracute diſeaſes, riſing from the offenſiue quantity and corrupt quality of the blood, that little Iron and ſmall inſtrument wherewith the <hi>Surgion</hi> doth phlebotomize, is a much more ſpeedy, ſovereigne and ſaving remedy: Thus what nature, what reaſon, what inſtances doe manifeſt we manifeſtly ſee. Now let vs returne to view what the Myntmaſter and Coyner of <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> doth pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuouſly pronounce. Speaking of his <hi>Aurum potabile page 4</hi> he vttereth theſe prodigious words <hi>Id nimirum omnes iam dictorum, nec non aliorum ſimplicum facultatis aequat, nec hoc ſalum, ſed multis modis ſuperat,</hi> that is, It doth not only equall, but exceed many degrees the vertues and faculties of al thoſe things before mentioned and of other ſimples. Thoſe things which were before mentioned were Vineger, Rhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barbe, Nitre, Lead, Quickſiluer, Vitriol, Champhre, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding with theſe innumerable more. Here we ſee his open and expreſſed profeſſion that<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> doth not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine in it ſelfe the vſes and vertues of all medicines in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall,
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:17643:9"/> but of every ſpeciall throughout the generall, and of every particular comprehended vnder the ſpecialls, for theſe particulars before mentioned are all of ſeverall kinds and ſpecies. This is a wonder, a miracle, a myſtery. Many vſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed God hath given vnto many particular things vnder the ſame kind, but all the ſeverall ſpecificall vſes of all other things of the ſame kind given vnto any one particular alone, nature did never knowe, nor the Sunne it ſelfe in this ſublu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary world did euer behold, Looke through all the Coaſts and Corners of the world, pervſe the Catalogue of all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite bounties and guifts of God and nature in all kinds, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them all, is not to be found, ſuch an vniverſality in an vnity, or an vnity of ſuch vniverſality. No man, no age, no art, no ſcience hath at any time knowne it. Of the impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie alſo thereof as in reaſon, ſo in religion the demonſtration is evident. God hath created nothing in vaine nor needleſly. All things are good which he hath made, and certainly if good, then good for ſome good end and for ſome good vſe. If every particular thing created, hath his particular good particular vſe and end, <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> his vſe is likewiſe but particular and can exclude no one thing created whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever from a particular goodnes and vſe, contayned in it ſelfe and not in another. This all ages, all times, all nations and people long before <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> was borne, haue euer witneſſed, and are able to giue the contrary affirmation, the lie vnto the face of the divell and the Apologiſt, creating ſo foule a monſter, out of the order and rule of all things crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by God. Many excellent things hath God created for man, which haue many excellent vſes; He hath created the medicines of the earth <hi>Eccleſiaſticus 36.4.</hi> and among them many haue their many excellent vſes, but any one creature or medicine whatſoeuer contayning in it ſelfe alone all the vſes of all other things of the ſame kind or fruſtrating or making needleſſe any one vſe or good quality giuen by God to any one particular whatſoeuer, as to affirme it, is in reaſon im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible,
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:17643:10"/> in nature monſtrous, ſo in religion moſt impious. Now let vs heare what the Apologiſt ſaith. It is not ſufficient (ſaith the Apologiſt <hi>page 5 <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

In his preface vnto the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der he tearmeth it <hi>Materia vniuerſalis perſe,</hi> that is a thing materially or in the materiall ſubſtance by it ſelfe alone vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall. Behold the face of Idolatry <hi>page 61</hi> of the Engliſh coppie, he likewiſe aboue the capacitie or reach of reaſon avowcheth that his Medicine neuer hurt any but euer profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted all. The ſame he iterateth <hi>page 107</hi> and <hi>page 122.</hi> Hee further avowcheth, <hi>page 97</hi> of the Latin coppie that if it happen into the hands of an vnskilfull diſpenſor, it cannot notwithſtanding by the moſt envious, be once inſtanced in any particular to haue giuen ſomuch as occaſion of hurt, which is incident to other excellent remedies. From abuſe by man there was neuer as yet any ſublunary thing created by God for man abſolute or free, how then can this Creature alone of his creation be excepted without impiety and intol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable arrogancie. <hi>page 55:</hi> he appropriateth this divine and miraculous medicine vnto himſelfe, ſaying that after God it bringeth moſt preſent remedie. Thus he maketh himſelfe and his medicine, or himſelfe in his medicine ſolely God his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond; In the ſame place he doth proclayme it to haue place where no Phyſitian or Phyſick humane can giue remedie or helpe, but onely the Celeſtiall and divine or heauenly, <hi>page 121.</hi> of the Engliſh coppie he ſaith it is of generall and extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary effects in all diſeaſes, ſexes, ages, circumſtances. The impoſſibility of theſe aſſertions in reaſon in nature, in Gods decree, all honeſt and wiſe men conſider. Now let vs duely examine whether his owne conſcience alſo doe not check it ſelfe herein; certainly in many places his own falfe tongue, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayeth his double and guilefull thoughts. Read <hi>page 15.
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:17643:10"/> line 2. 3. 4. 5.</hi> of the latin coppy. <hi>Nihilominus hic conſiderari velim, &amp; caetera.</hi> There he confeſſeth that there is no ſuch ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> but that by other meanes as well as by it, men may aſpire vnto the top and perfection of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicall curation, as alſo that there are other wayes vnto the ſame wood for health aſwell as by that. Theſe words are left out in the engliſh Coppie, ſee <hi>page 18</hi> thereof. Reade his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>face alſo vnto the Reader, there he confeſſeth that he vſeth and mixeth other <hi>Vegetables</hi> in the adminiſtration and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſation of his <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> and he commendeth the ſame vſe and cuſtome vnto the rationall and learned phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an. Behold how truth here vnawares ſtealeth out of his owne mouth. How farr in divers other places his tong hath over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>runne his wit, in the reaſonles and boundles adoration of his golden incomparable vniuerſality, is not before obſcure. Here now ſee how by his owne mouth that <hi>Pancreſton,</hi> that vnlimited vniuerſality that adaequation of temper in it ſelfe, reducing all other things into temper <hi>page. 4. 5.</hi> is here con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in it ſelfe not to be ſo abſolute, but to borrow aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and many vſes of other diſcrepant and different things or natures. Yea he doth in the ſame place acknowledge it to be requiſite prudence to adioyne them vnto his vniuerſall medicine: and commendeth it vnto the rationall and iuditious phyſitians diſcretion therein. Thus vſuall and eaſie is it for men who either deſire to diſſemble thoſe things they knowe, or intend to iuſtifie thoſe things which they knowe vniuſt, to be betrayed by their owne memory and to contradict them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues. And thus by nature, by reaſon, by his owne poſitions and confeſſion, is the vniuerſality of the Apologiſt his <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum potabile</hi> from the vnlimited ſtiles, the intollerable titular tranſcendence and ſole ſupremacy reduced vnto more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſt and moderate termes, yea euen by pronunciates out of his owne mouth. Miſtake not (worthy Reader) I doe not denie that golde it ſelfe in medicine hath many excellent v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. I denie not divers wayes of the profitable and vſefull
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:17643:11"/> preparation. I doe ingeniouſly graunt that gold in his owne kinde (although queſtioned in D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Anth.</hi> his preparation) may be, and is an excellent medicine, as divers other excellent me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in other kinds are, but his exceſſiue and vnreaſonable extolling thereof beyond meaſure and meane, and the ſlaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derous derogation thereby from all other bleſſed remedies, vnto which God their Creator hath giuen their ſeuerall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct ſpecifical vertues aſwell as vnto <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> is that which modeſt eares do abhorr, and I cannot but iuſtly taxe.

               <p>Moſt diſeaſes conſiſt (ſaith the <hi>Apologiſt</hi>) in diſtemper, <hi>Ergo</hi> the moſt temperate medicines are the beſt remidies to reduce them into temper.

                  </gap>. The firſt doth ſerue properly to direct to keepe or conſerue the body in health. The ſecond doth guide vnto the reductio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the body into health againe, being therein decayed. As while the body is in health it is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt reaſon and rule to aſſume thereinto things that are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate, for feare of begetting diſtemper thereby, ſo when the body is ſicke and diſtempered, it is not only art, but com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:17643:13"/> ſenſe and reaſon to endeavour to bring it into health and temper, by ſuch differing and contrary things as many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly alter and change the diſtemperature. It is true, in the conſervation of health, thoſe things which are moſt tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate are moſt fitt. Firſt becauſe they breed no exceſſe. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly becauſe they being more neere and like with leſſe offence &amp; alteration they are at any time added or conioyned where vſe and need is. For this cauſe it is as truly, as anciently ſaid <hi>Similima, Similimis conſervantur.</hi> In diſeaſes and diſtempers the caſe is otherwiſe. There the maine reſpect and indication is the reduction of diſtemper into temper. This is not done by things alike or temperate, but by things contrary, So ſaith <hi>Hypocrates Aph. 19. lib. 5. Contrariorum contraria eſt ratio?</hi> I pray tell me (good S<hi rend="sup">r</hi>) in a cold ſtomacke is a draught of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate ale, better, or a ginger ſpiced cup? If your braine haue loſt his common ſenſe, aske your ſtomacke when it is op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed with cold. Is there not a manyfeſt difference of beni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitt vnto a cold digeſtion betweene a draught of temperate beare or other like liquor and a cup of wine that doth many<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly heate? Doth not experience avouch that <hi>Diatrion-pipe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rion, Diaga langa, Diacumini,</hi> things of a ſenſible exceſſe in heate do farr more happily and preſently warme a cold, raw, and windie belly then <hi>Aromaticum Roſatum</hi> or any other compounds of the like more temperate ſimples. Who will denie that methridat is hott and in the ſame vſe, <hi>diaſcordium</hi> more temperate. In a caſe wherein they are both in the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall, profiittable, if there be in ſome one particular reſpect a more ſpeciall neceſſity of heating. Who will not preferr the firſt before the ſecond, and the ſecond alſo before the firſt, where is more danger or feare of heate? It is not therefore the even temper of qualities, but the manifeſt odds of qualities that vſually in contrary diſtempers of the body doth both indeed and really and alſo to the ſenſe and feeling of every man, profitt himſelfe and correct his diſtemper. Thus farr hath better reaſon then (it ſeemeth is knowne vnto your
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:17643:14"/> ſelfe) offered vnto you ſpectacles through which it is eaſie to ſee and conſider the ſlender weight and worth of this your worthleſſe reaſon. Let vs now review it with better eyes, thus muſt your reaſon neceſſarily reaſon ſyllogiſed.</p>
               <p>If moſt diſeaſes conſiſt in diſtemper, then that which is moſt temperate is the beſt remedie. But moſt diſeaſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in diſtemper <hi>Ergo</hi> That which is moſt temperate is beſt remedie.</p>
               <p>The vacillation and falſehood both of Maior and Minor is euident; for if all or moſt diſeaſes did alone conſiſt in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper (as they doe not) yet would not that rightly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferre, that therefore thoſe things which are moſt temperate, are the beſt remedies, ſince it is apparent (as is before pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued) that by contraries thoſe things which are intemperate, are onelie reduced or brought to be temperate. The weaknes and vntruth of the Minor alſo, is vndoubtedly mantfeſt vnto all well exerciſed Phyſitians, who moſt ſeldome meete with ſuch diſeaſes as ſolely and ſimply grow from diſtemper a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone, no diſeaſe almoſt, or generallie, or for the moſt part pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting it ſelfe, which beſide the diſtemper, hath not an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſiue quantitie or burden of euill and vitious humors, as true cauſe thereof. Thus the Maior and Minor, failing the hope of any good concluſion, is verie ſlender. And thus alſo is the ſecond reaſon of the Apologiſt like vnto the firſt, and both like himſelfe, all in ſhowes and boaſting ſhadowes, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in truth and ſubſtance. Notwithſtanding becauſe wee will not altogether diſpoile him, and leaue him naked, hauing alreadie diſarmed him, we will out of our tender hearts, yeeld and allow vnto the temperate remedies, in diſtempers ſome place or reſpect, although he neither doth or can winne it, or deſerue it at our hands. We muſt neceſſarily here diſtinguiſh, concerning diſtempers. There is a diſtemper farre exceeding temper, and there is a diſtemper within the latitude of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, that is not much wanting or differing from temper, though perfectly or ſtrictly no temper. In that diſtemper

Galen. lib. de conſtit.

But in that diſtemper, wherein is manifeſt exceſſiue oddes, it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all latitude extreamelie falſe, that remedies within the latitude of temper, or that are temperate, ſhould reduce the temper. For example, if a man be diſtempered with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſiue, violent, or furious heate, there temperate remedies betweene heate and colde are ſoone maſtered and made fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, or profit little, or for a ſhort time. But where a man is diſtempered with heate, in a ſmall exceſſe, or very ſlender degree, there temperate things, though they cannot mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly coole, yet may they ſomewhat refreſh by their propin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitie and neareneſſe vnto requiſite and deſired cooling. If theſe like temperate things in ſuch a caſe, carrie with their temperature a Cordiall qualitie, then may they much more in that reſpect be proſperous. Thus it is clearelie diſtinguiſhed how farre foorth that which is temperate, may reduce into temper that which is intemperate, as alſo where it ſhalbe ſo farre from giuing temper, that it ſhalbe ouercome of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper. This may now bee applied vnto <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> His excellent temper (if it bee ſo temperate in Antonie's preparation, as it is in his predication) may in ſome degrees of diſtemper profite; but in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Thus you haue good reaſon for your money, for your gold, for your liquor, which out of reaſon, and beyond reaſon, you would extoll. As your reaſons in their proofe come lame, halting and limping home, ſo your flouriſhing ſhewes of ſome ſcholaſticall termes, are meere termes without their true ſenſe, and rightly apprehended fubſtance. This is ſeene in your palpable ignorance, endeavouring to ſalue that

As if vnderſtanding men could be ſo blinded or enchanted by your miſts of ſeeming learning, as not to diſtinguiſh how a meane and temper, vnto an extreame or diſtemper, may in a large or looſe ſenſe bee tearmed contrary; and yet in the true and exquiſite nature of contraries, be indeed no contrary. I will in few words, make this your groſſe errour more plaine. The queſtion is, whether <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> by it ſelfe doe cure contrary diſtempers, do actually reſiſt in cold diſeaſes, cold; in hot diſeaſes, heat. You affirme it, and thus you would proue your affirmation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries (ſay you) doe cu e contraries. <hi>Auru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> potabile</hi> is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, &amp; therefore it doth cure contraries. Your Minor, <hi>viz.</hi> that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> is a contrary you thus proue. It is a thing temperate, therefore it is contrary to that which is intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. See now the fallacy. You hold the word contrary, but you are already runne beyond the ſenſe of your propoſed contrary. Our proiect &amp; mention was concerning ſuch con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traries, as directly, immediatly, and actually oppoſe &amp; reſiſt each other, (as heat, cold; drineſſe, moiſture; in the queſtion firſt propounded doe oppoſe really one the other) and now you ſlip from that contrary vnto another kinde of contrary, and in another reſpect ſo called, namely vnto ſuch a contrary as is no reall actiue contrary, but a meere<note n="*" place="margin">Non contrari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſed contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictorium. vide Scalig. exercit. <hi>5.</hi> ſect. <hi>1.</hi>

Thus where you ſhould haue proued <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> chaulke, you goe about to prooue it cheeſe, yea and cheeſe becauſe chaulke. This is cheeſe to choake a Daw, as ſaith the country prouerb.

That you may hereafter in this matter reaſon more pertinently with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch confuſion, and may more diſtinctly therein appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend your ſelfe, I will giue you ſome few obſeruations.

Touch the temper of your gold with this touch-ſtone. Secondly, remember that true and reall contraries doe extreamely, or in an extreame degree or di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance,

Euery Mountbanke in this kinde, will ſtare you out of countenance. Praiſes are windie bables. It is eaſie vpon a Mould-hill, to founde a Mountaine of vaine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious tearmes.

How ingeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly doth he make the praiſes exceed the matter, and yet the matter no more then it ſelfe, the jeſt ſeeming ſerious, and the ſerious no jeſt. Read <hi>Cornelius Agrippae de laude ſtultitiae,</hi> you ſhall ſee with how ſportiue a wit, or wittie ſport, he jeſteth with good earneſt, in extolling that quality, wherein thorow your whole Apologie you doe exceed and riot. Let praiſes therefore paſſe, you promiſed a third argument, we expect that, ſince praiſes are not proofes. Perhaps you will ſay, that you had come vnto your argument at laſt, if your memory had not met with a rubbe, which carried your byas out of the way. An abiect obiection forſooth, did take you aſide, and whiſpered in your eare, that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> being a thing in manifeſt qualities, manifeſtly temperate, could not poſſibly, or in any true or ſound reaſon or judgment, produce or exerciſe any manifeſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. In ouer-zealous deſire of anſwere of the objection, you caſt away the matter in hand vtterly, and forgetting both
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:17643:17" rendition="simple:additions"/> your ſelfe and it, runne headlong into an old ſong, oft before chatteringly chaunted, <hi>videlicet,</hi> that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> is tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in qualities, and yet ſo excelling therein, that it is able to maſter, or quell any oppoſing or reſiſting contrary what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer. This is an vgly monſter in reaſon or nature. If you had once ſollidly proued this aſſertion, the hated repetition might be better digeſted, but in your proofes hetherto ſo ſlightly trifling and performing ſhadowes, the groſneſſe of your contradictions muſt needs beget a loathing of the rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe of ſuch rawe learning. You doe not vnderſtand what it is, <hi>petere principium,</hi> or to diſpute <hi>ex non conceſſis,</hi> otherwiſe you might conceaue, how vnſauory it is vnto men learned, to heare you ſo oft and rudely harping vpon one and the ſame iarring ſtring, and yet ſuppoſe that it is ſufficient pleaſing muſicke. I will therefore in this your inculcation of the ſame former error, confute you likewiſe by referring you vnto my former confutation thereof in your ſecond reaſon. Marke it well, and if you meane to make it your marke whereat to ſhoot your bolt, looke you miſſe it not, nor take it amiſſe, leaſt as you haue in this your Apologie iniuriouſly quartred me, ſo in the next replication, I hang in ſo equall ballance, that your leaſt want of waight ſhall not eſcape the ſeuereſt cenſure. Your concluding here without premiſſes, meerely vpon praiſes, your reaſoning without reaſon, your iterated iugling of <hi>Simile</hi> vnto <hi>Contrarium,</hi> and <hi>Contrarium</hi> into <hi>Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mile:</hi> of <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> ſometimes into both, ſometimes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to neither, ſometimes into either, I doe with equall recipro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation anſwere and not anſwere.

And this is according vnto your excellent temper, and yet con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, and therefore contrary becauſe temper. Thus haue I anſwerably, or as fitteth in anſwere, toied with your toies, and put a tricke vpon your trickes, hoping as it is in me, only of your image and example, the repreſentatiue, ſo it may bee

               <p>
                  <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> (ſaith our diſputant) is an vniuerſall me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, in conſideration of the nature of the ſicke, or of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe or ſickneſſe. For if the diſeaſe doth lie vpon the patient as a burthen, and the ſtrength is not ſufficient to beare or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure it vnto the end, what is here to be done? Whether is the ſtrength to be maintained and cheriſhed, that it may endure and beare the burthen, or to bee ouerthrowne, or periſh by attempting to remoue the burthen? This is his wiſe propoſe to no purpoſe. What if it ſhould bee granted vnto him that euery diſeaſe is a burthen which nature is not ſufficient to endure, and that in ſuch a caſe the ſtrength of nature is to be altogether cheriſhed and foſtered, and not by any endeauour of remouall of her burthen to be iniured or oppreſſed? What will he inferre herevpon? It doth not follow from hence, <hi>Ergo, Aurum potabile</hi> is an vniuerſall medicine, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poundeth as his intended concluſion. It only from hence can follow, or inferre, <hi>ergo Aurum potabile,</hi> in the propoſed par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular caſe may doe good. But hee frameth from his former diſcourſe this conſequence, or collection, forſooth that euery diſeaſe may bee maſtered, or cured, through the ſtrength of nature, by the helpe of Cordialls. And from hence haply hee hopeth it may be with ſome likelihood conceaued and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> being a Cordiall, may bee hereby concluded an vniverſall medicine. This is farre fetched and about the buſh. If we ſhould bountifully, or rather prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:17643:18"/> yeeld vnto him both the former propoſitions, yet doe they neither iointly nor apart inferre his concluſion, which notwithſtanding, in them both he promiſed and propounded in the very firſt words of his reaſon. Thus therefore failing and wandring out of the way, at length hee borroweth the helpe of Mules to drawe him out of the mire of his fowly confuſed, and inexplicate reaſon. As it falleth out (ſaith hee) with Mules that carry burthens, ſo doth it with the ſicke. It is not fit alwaies to take of the burthen that they may feed. It is more trouble and hinderance indeed vnto the idle driuer (as in his owne experience the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> hath haply ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times found) it is more trouble, I ſay, to the driuer, in feeding or refreſhing his Mules, to take downe their packes or bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, but if the poore Mules could ſpeake, they would tell you from their owne manifeſt ſenſe, that it were more eaſe and pleaſure vnto them, to feed without the incumbrance of their loads vpon their backes in the <hi>interim.</hi> And common experience doth tell vs that burthens are vſually remooued from the trauelling or laboring beaſt, not onely when they goe daily vnto their reſt, but vpon many other occaſions. The <hi>Apologiſt</hi> compareth his ſicke patients vnto Mules, but he vſeth them worſe, if hee tie them perpetually vnto their burthens, and tell them for their comforts, that <hi>Aurum pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> ſhall refreſh them, and inable them to beare them ſtill. No doubt but they had rather be rid of their burthens, then comforted to beare them. Every diſeaſe is not ſuch a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then as is impoſſible to be remoued, and in thoſe kindes, they are nor only made Mules, but Aſſes, that for <hi>Aurum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile</hi> his ſake will beare them ſtill. Many diſeaſes there are exceeding tolerance, and greater then can long be borne, if not either in part lightned, or leſſned, or wholly remoued; and <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> cannot make them leſſe. In both theſe caſes, or kindes of diſeaſes, <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> is of ſmall vſe. In the one, the burthen being wholly remoued, is of no vſe at all. In the other, vntill the burthen be otherwiſe remoued, it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:17643:19"/> can be onely a comfort or reliefe in the miſery, but no releaſe from the miſery. This, all Phyſitians know to be vndoubted in their patients, howſoeuer Groomes doe practiſe in their mules. There is a <hi>plethora ad vaſa,</hi> and a <hi>plethora ad vires.</hi> The firſt is a weight or burthen ſo farre aboue meaſure, that the veſſell cannot oft hold it without danger of breaking. The other exceedeth not the capacitie of the continent veſſels, but is more then the ſtrength can tolerate, except in ſome part vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loaded. The like may be ſaid of <hi>Cacochymia,</hi> or exceſſe of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious humors out of the veſſels. All theſe ſorts of burthens are common in moſt diſeaſes. In all theſe it is better to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liuered from their incumbrance and oppreſſion, then to bee comforted and refreſhed to beare their loade. It is true, where it is not poſſible to remoue them ſecurely with any ſafety, there it remaineth onely vnto confirmation and comfortation of the ſtrength with more eaſe to endure them. But this is not an vſuall or ordinarie condition in all, or moſt diſeaſes. In ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny diſeaſes the cauſe remoueable being remoued, health doth follow ſpontaneouſly, and vntill it be remoued, there can be otherwiſe no poſſibilitie thereof. In many diſeaſes it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to remoue the cauſe, and that remaining, there is no poſſibilitie in Cordials, or any other meanes to cure them. Where they may be remoued, ſhall <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> perſwade to keepe them? Where they are not to be remoued, can <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum potabile</hi> be eſteemed any more then a Palliatiue, a Flatte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer, a Iuggler, a Coſner of opinion or paine for a time? It is a wonder to ſee how theſe drivers of Mules ſuppoſe the world a generation of fooles, and ſtudie to beget and multiplie (as they ſuppoſe) among aſſes ſoles, for the propagation of their vaine-glorious hereſie, and grand impoſture. Wee haue not hetherto found the leaſt weight or worth in any one reaſon. This laſt reaſon offered in forme of a queſtion (as is his myſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call guilefull maner in them all) is for want of good deliuery, ſo deformed and diſfigured, that it can hardly be reduced into any forme or figure of right diſpute, or the vnmeaſurable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>definities
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:17643:19"/> thereof be faſhioned into any moode or meaſure, that may containe his promiſed purpoſe in any ſort. It is far more eaſie to driue one of his Mules into a pinfold, then to drawe him into a Syllogiſme that may hold him within his liſts. Let vs notwithſtanding, with beſt fauour and aduan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage vnto himſelfe that is poſſible, thus faſhion for him his confuſed Chaos of diſpute, into ſome ſhape of likely reaſon. Thus happily he may moſt fairely argue. If ſome Cordialls are neceſſary in all diſeaſes, and <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> containe in it ſelfe the vſe and vertue of all Cordialls, then is it an vniuerſall medicine in all diſeaſes. But ſome Cordialls are neceſſary in all diſeaſes, <hi>Ergo, Aurum potabile</hi> is an vniuerſall medicine.</p>
               <p>We will grant that ſome Cordialls are neceſſary in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes in reſpect of the due care of natures preſeruation, but we will deny that all Cordialls are neceſſary in all diſeaſes, or for all different vſes, or for all ſeaſons in any diſeaſe. We deny alſo that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> is any ſuch Cordiall wherein is comprehended the vertue and power of all Cordialls. Theſe points remaine ſtill to bee proued as at the firſt beginning. Vntill therefore the <hi>Apologiſt</hi> haue firſt manifeſtly proued them, we doe aske the good behauiour againſt this trifling and brabling intruſion vpon a common and vniuerſall right, for which he hetherto hath not, or euer can ſhew any good e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. It fitteth not a man reputed learned, ſo oft to affirme that he doth not demonſtrate, nor ſo oft to iterate and incul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that thing, which irreſiſtibly and inuincibly he hath not cleerely founded vpon ſcientificall grounds. He that is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in defectiue, is no better then a babler, a pratler, a tatler, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo in verba proiectus locutuleius blattero,</hi> ſaith <hi>Gellius, Noct.

For the Phyſitian (ſaith he) in all diſeaſes ought thither to direct all his evacuations, where nature doth regularly and critically in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them. How now will <hi>Anthony</hi> ſatisfie and anſwere <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony? Anthony</hi> firſt ſaid, that without purging or evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the immediate continent and antecedent cauſes of diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, (which is the proper, ordinarie, and vſuall office, skill, &amp; direction of the Phyſitian) health could hardly, ſcarcely, or hopefully follow. Now laſtly, <hi>Anthony</hi> againe ſaith, that Nature without the Phyſitian, will better finde helpe and meanes for her ſelfe. The cauſe of this difference betweene <hi>Anthony</hi> and himſelfe, is the want of right diſtinction. That therefore I may mediate betweene his meaning and himſelfe, I will thus helpe him to diſtinguiſh. Nature is to be conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered two wayes: The firſt way is as ſhe worketh regularly, perfectly, or ſufficiently, and there the Phyſitian is ſolely to imitate Nature, and to be directed by her, and her miniſter, &amp; and no maſter. The ſecond way is, as Nature irregularly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniently, or inperfectly worketh, and then and there muſt the Phyſitian be her directer, maſter, commander, and orde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rer.

In the ſcorching flame, and furious fire of an exquiſite peracute, or perperacute pleureſie, phrenſie, <hi>Angina Peripuenmonia, Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nochus,</hi> and divers other like, if Nature demonſtrate her ſelfe compleatly, and effectually able to vent ſufficiently, or com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petently by any prompt or convenient naturall paſſage, the fierie ſmoake and fume of the boiling veines, menacing her ſuffocation, then is there no vſe but an abuſe in any vſe of Phyſicke or Phyſitian. But if Nature in her ſtrength funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damentally quaile, by the oppreſſion of her enemy, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in the quantitie of the humor, and be beyond the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of her durance or toleration grieued, though the cordiall
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:17643:22"/> may flatter or eaſe for a miſerable time, the Phyſitian muſt then either enable or helpe Nature, in her ſelfe helpleſſe, or ſhe muſt periſh remedileſſe. This is vſually obſerued, when ordinarily and ofr, the Phyſitian is manifeſtly ſeene to recall the yeelding ghoſt, againſt the before irreſiſtible impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and incumbrances of Nature in her ſelfe. Doth not the Phyſitian oft and vſually by giuing a vent ſolely vnto the blood &amp; veines, as is before ſaid, immediately thereby re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viue and reduce Nature, before this happie ſuccour and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply, eternally and vnrecouerably ſinking? In theſe like caſes, Nature hauing no power in her ſelfe, while the oppreſſion &amp; invincible burthen remaineth vpon her, the life or benefit of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the moſt excellent Cordials, neceſſarily do periſh with her. But let the Phyſitian lend his hand to remoue the oppreſſor, &amp; the oppreſſed is often ſeene able either to raiſe &amp; comfort it ſelfe, or at leaſt to receiue comfort &amp; refreſhing from with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, which before was offered in vaine vnto her, in her inſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibilitie thereof. For this cauſe ſaith <hi>Galen, Mirum eſt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modo ſe abijcit Natura, cùm quod tentat, excludere nequeat.</hi> It is a wonder (ſaith he) how Nature is deiected, and how ſhee as it were deſpairing, caſteth away all hope or care of her ſelfe, when being ouer-loaded beyond her ſtrength, ſhe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempteth by any kinde of evacuation, or excretion, to caſt her burthen off, and cannot. Therc is no man ſo ſtupid, as to thinke that in theſe caſes there is any hope in Cordials, ſince they cannot giue vnto Nature ſtrength aboue her ſtrength, and Nature to beare burthens importable, intollerable, and impoſſible vnto her. That vſually ſuch burthens doe fall v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pon Nature, euery mans eye and daylie experience doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold. And thus it is made manifeſt, how in many diſeaſes, Nature abſolutely muſt periſh, and cannot ſubſiſt without the Phyſitians hand or helpe, by due evacuations to remoue her oppreſſions, which exceed the extent of her vtmoſt power and ſtrength to endure, beare, or reſiſt. Although therefore ſometimes Nature is alone, and by her ſelfe, able
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:17643:22"/> perfectly to enodate her owne health and recouery. And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though the Phyſitian, when Nature is not able of her ſelfe, doth and ought to helpe and aſſiſt her, by the imitation and direction of her owne courſe and cuſtome in her owne regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and perfect workes, yet ſimply, generally, abſolutely, and without diſtinction to pronounce, that Nature is better able to helpe her ſelfe without the Phyſitian, is a palpable teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monie of inconſideratneſſe, confuſion, and ignorance of vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. And this hath beene the common cuſtome of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologiſt, thorow the whole Apologie, in all parts and places thereof without difference or diſtinction, from a raw and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digeſted knowledge and learning, perpetually belching ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamely contraries.

Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though you haue (as you ſay) perſwaded, yet can you not perſwade. Certainely you perſwade your ſel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>e of your ſelfe too well, and therefore of others ſo ill. See whether you can
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:17643:23"/> ſee no fault in your ſeife, and your owne perſwaſions in the firſt paſſed part of your Apologie. You ſhall there finde mee your friend to helpe you therein. As there, ſo in the ſecond part you boaſt of reaſon and experience. Your reaſons are ſhort, as you confeſſe, as I will declare, and as all men may ſee. In your experiences (which really and indeed are rather other mens teſtimonies) you abound. So it befitteth him who wanteth true reaſon and iudgment, and buildeth vpon ſuch inartificiall arguments, meerely ariſing from the fancies and ſenſe of diſtreſſed patients, tranſported vſually by their affection, moſt ſeldome by reaſon and true judgment gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded. You tell vs, let the envious barke, and ſay that your gold is no gold: but this you ſay is more certaine, then that is moſt certaine, that a medicine an hundreth times more preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous then gold, is by you out of gold deduced. If your proofe heereof bee onely equall vnto that which formerly with the ſame titles and tearmes you haue exalted, and falſely dignified, it is leſſe then nothing, ſince out of nothing cannot iſſue any thing. We will now attend how according to your promiſe, you doe proue your ſelfe maſter and maker of the genuine, true and no counterfeit <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> Vnto this purpoſe you produce three reaſons. The firſt is this, That me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine which is made of gold, diſſolued without corroſiues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a ſubſtance or co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſiſtence, like hony potable, eaſily diſſolued in any liquor, is the moſt excellent medicine liquor, &amp; true vndoubted <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> This is the Maior, the Minor fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loweth. But (ſay you) my medicine is ſuch, namely gold diſſol<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ued without Corroſiues, into a ſubſtance or conſiſtence, like hony potable, eaſily diſſolued in any liqor: <hi>Erg.</hi> my medicine is the true <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> We deny your Minor, &amp; expect it by you proved. In ſtead of thee expected proofe: you tell vs that you haue formerly demonſtrated it in a former treatiſe, and referre vs thereto. In that treatiſe, according to my pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe in the beginning, I muſt remit you vnto thoſe learned men, who haue there, and for that alreadie taken you into
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:17643:24"/> their handling. I will therefore onely make a ſerutinie and tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinie of thoſe your reaſons and proofes, which I doe find here. In your Minor you ſay, that your medicine is gold, diſſolued without Corroſiues. This I do denie, and you cannot prooue it, except you make your concealed <hi>Aqua Menſtrualis</hi> knowne, I will not credit you, but that there are Corroſiue vertues and powers therein. Except therefore you do make knowne that your grand ſecret, your <hi>totum ſcire,</hi> &amp; <hi>ſecretum,</hi> your argument and proofe is for all hope of progreſſe, loſt and drowned in your <hi>Aqua Menſtrualis.</hi> And there we leaue your firſt proofe, cowardly hiding it ſelfe. I need not tell you, that <hi>Aurum potabile, per aquam fortem, per fraudem com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitum, ſolutum aquis regijs,</hi> is reproued &amp; damned of Chy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micks themſelues. That that <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> which is <hi>debite modo &amp; comprobato ſapientibus,</hi> is knowne vnto you, you doe not make knowne vnto vs, but leaue it obſcured and ſunke in the puddle of your menſtruall water. We come vnto your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond proofe, by which you would convince, that your vni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſall medicine is the true <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> The medicine, ſay you, which haue the genuine, proper, and inſeparable effects of <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> is to be taken and eſteemed the ſame. But your vniverſall medicine hath thoſe vniverſal and ſolely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per effects of <hi>Aurum potabile, Ergo</hi> it is the ſame. We denie not your Maior from the immediate and proper effects, vnto the true immediate cauſe, the ſequele is moſt certaine and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. Your Minor we doubt and thinke falſe, and therfore we vrge and require your proofe and manifeſtation thereof. But you homely and plainely tell vs, that your medicine hath giuen and yeelded ſufficient evidences, teſtimonies, and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, only worthie <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> And thus except we will take your bare word and credit therein, or ſtay for further proofe out of your ſucceeding teſtimonies, the promiſed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent proofe is not performed. Your third proofe is taken out of the admirable and wonderfull manner, falling out in the workmanſhip of your <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> that is, the permanent
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:17643:24"/> and perfect diſſolution thereof, the aſcent in an exceeding red ſhape or forme by the <hi>Alembike.</hi> When wee haue ſeene the Gold in ſolid ſubſtance firſt put into the <hi>Alembike,</hi> and after without fraud cloſed therein; laſtly, aſcending in the mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned forme, and withall doe know your <hi>Aqua menſtrualis,</hi> we are then<note n="*" place="margin">Chryſopaeidare poſſunt alijs me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallis qualitates accidentarias auri veri, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rem, duritiem, pondus &amp;c.

Thus you ſee how you per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade your ſelfe too well of your ſelfe. You thinke better of your credit then it is, and truſting thereto ouermuch, your laſt proofe is as the firſt and ſecond, voide and annihilate. But you reply, that you haue many learned Phyſitians, eye-witneſſes of this your experience. We anſwere and oppoſe your owne confeſſion, <hi>viz.</hi> that your <hi>Aqua menſtrualis</hi> is knowne vnto no man. If no man know it but your ſelfe, then no man but your ſelfe can ſatisfie vs, whether there be therein any corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiue power or vertue, and (as we ſaid before) we are reſolued not to credit you.

Laſtly, I will oppoſe vnto your teſtimonies blazed in honour of <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> ſuch counter-teſtimonies, as ſhall ſound as much in diſhonour. Firſt, for the invaliditie in generall of your teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, and iointly they are all defectiue in one of theſe two kindes. Some are directly falſe. All the reſt witneſſe no more but the felicitie, good ſucceſſe, and happy iſſues and euents of your medicine, which is no ſufficient or compleat ſatisfacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for the authoritie, lawfulneſſe, or allowance of your medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. Many diſeaſes haue beene by ſleight meanes prudently guided, admirably cured. Many diſeaſes likewiſe haue beene cured by chance, when all humane helpe hath vtterly beene diſpaired. I did my ſelfe knowe a Gentleman cured of a long and Cronicall head-ake and giddineſſe, by a rude blowe with a ſtaffe vpon his head, plentifully cauſing him to bleed, with great danger of his life. I knewe another by taking ratsbane vnwillingly from a poyſner, diſpatched of an inueterate and incurable french poxe, many yeares before ſetled in his bones all vſefull helpe in that kinde wearied, and a long time made fruſtrate. I haue read an hiſtory of a woman, who being wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried with her husbands<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> long and chargeable ſickneſſe (think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing therby to diſpatch him of his miſery) gaue him the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of a Toad, whereby he was preſently recouered. I doe read of another woman in whom the dropſie had ouergrown the reuocation thereof by any ordinary courſe, at length ſhe chanced from an high place to fall, and hitting her belly vpon a ſharpe ſtone, it made way and paſſage for the hidropicall water, and the woman was thereby deliuered. Theſe good iſſues or euents, doe not commend theſe medicines, or their
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:17643:26"/> vſe, nor for that cauſe can giue them a ſupremacy or princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palitie aboue all others. Neither can the multitude of teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, or reports of their admirable ſucceſſe iuſtifie their preſcriptions. If the teſtimonies of good euents, or iſſues were ſufficient, the hardie <hi>Empericke,</hi> the <hi>Magitian,</hi> and <hi>Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor</hi> would proue the moſt excellent Phiſitians, who in all ages haue abounded, the one with wonderous, the other with ſupernaturall and miraculous ſucceſſes. Concerning the one I haue knowne my ſelfe (and it is not difficult at this day to produce innumerable knowne witneſſes of the beſt worth &amp; eſtimation, both in Northampton ſhire, and in other Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries) I haue knowne diuers practiſers in this kinde, who with certaine ſecret words, croſſed Napl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ns, &amp; the like, haue oft and vſually found good ſucceſſe in deſperate diſeaſes, when Art hath giuen place, or could not preuaile. Concer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning the multitude of teſtimonies, touching good iſſues in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, and deceitfull curations, in regard both of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour and eminence of perſonages, it would bee tedious and ſcandalous to write. <hi>Reginald Scot</hi> doth fulfill more then meaſure in this kinde in his diſcouery. How eaſie it is alſo to gaine fame and a high name among vulgars, let Tobacco vaunt and boaſt it ſelfe. In his firſt arriuall into this king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, there was ſcarce one mouth which did not open in his praiſe, &amp; all diſeaſes did quake at his feareful rumour, whiles it menaced their generall ruine and exile from men. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes which it was then ſaid to haue cured, were infinite, and adminiſtred admirable matter of laughter in this kinde. Our late Welling borroughe well had in a ſhort time gained for every drop thereof almoſt a flood of praiſes. No man depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from thence vncured. <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> doth now play the ſame deſcant at an higher rate, but cannot ſtraine vnto an higher note, then the harmonious applauſe and noiſe of that wells praiſe as long as the muſicke laſted. I might abound in many more, and in more then too many examples in theſe kindes. Theſe ſodaine glorious puffes of praiſes howſoeuer
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:17643:27"/> in men full of wonder &amp; eaſily blaſted with admiration they obtaine a violent obſeſſion of their vulgar opinions, wiſe men are more ſlowly ſurpriſed with ſuch raſh incurſions of vaine credulitie and ſelfe conceit. Theſe conſiderations well weighed how can you expect to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>aue your vniuerſall medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine eſteemed worthy authorization or to bee pure and vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counterfeit merely in reſpect of his fame, ſpreading renowne, and common voice, or in regard of the glorious oſtentation of happy add ſuccesfull iſſues alone amongſt men, who know not, nor can acknowledge, or take notice of the reaſon, work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and compoſition thereof, and thence aſſure them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues of the due and right accommodation. No truly adui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Phiſitian can thinke either the credit of teſtimonies in the ſuccesfull events, or another mans experience and informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on equall or equiualent vnto his owne knowledge, ſince eue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry iudicious Phyſitian for his owne iuſtification in all his vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right actions, ought in himſelfe, and not in another, to knowe the temper and conſtitution of all things, which he ſhall law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully apply or vſe; and to examine ſeriouſly and duly, how it conſenteth firſt generally with allowance of reaſon, and alſo is proportioned to his particular. Thus euery honeſt and vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Artiſt is bound, and will be ready to giue account of all his actions in euery circumſtance, and in each particular. It is not the good iſſue or euent of a medicine, that doth or can alone commend a Phiſitian, but his owne preciſe know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the anatomie thereof, guided and gouerned by rule and likely reaſon vnto the likely iſſue. He is an Idiot or foole that meerely iudgeth by euents. That Phiſitian therefore doth not anſwere his dutie and required worth, who led like a blinde ignorant by the opinion of another man, and not knowing himſelfe the nature and qualitie of a medicine, doth traditionally at a ſecond hand, and vpon anothers commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation preſcribe it. He that applaudeth himſelfe herein, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoeuer in his owne golden opinion, prowd of a gay new knowledge, he ſuppoſeth that he out-ſtrippeth other meaner
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:17643:27"/> wits, and howſoeuer with glittering ſhadowes he may for a time amaze vniudging men, yet vnto him, who is ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and truly wiſe, and can diſcerne the miraculous illuſions, which raſh lightneſſe is able to worke in common braines, he ſhall cleerely appeare through a faire ſuperficiall ſhew with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out, a ſubſtantiall foole within.

Looke not to build your owne true worth vpon others teſtimonies of your me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine. There are other more true teſtimonies and vndoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted euidences of true worth, then are to be ſeene in the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of a dead inſtrument; the true liuelyhood and perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction whereof, conſiſteth in the prudence, guidance, and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of the learned Phiſitian. Your vniuerſall and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall medicine, can be but a materiall and ſublunary body: but the diſcreet and artificiall accommodation thereof, is a ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:17643:28"/> vertue, and power of the ſoule. In the better part there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of all other Phiſitians participate with you, yea you cannot deny that many exceed you. How dare you then ſo much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore and worſhip a ſenſeleſſe and earthly inſtrument, as in the ouerflowing praiſe thereof, to drowne the true praiſes, which God aboue and beyond it hath g uen to his owne gifts graces and heauenly endowments of true ſcience, pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, ſagacity, and iudgement, which hee hath ordained to rule, guid, order, and diſpoſe the right diſpenſation of all ſuch outward meanes, and inſtruments of what excellency ſoeuer. Contract then your ſwelling pride in ſo ſmall a merit. Let it not ſo ranckly ouerflowe the banks of modeſty and reaſon. I ſee among your teſtimonies the names of ſome honorable, and worthy perſonages, and I may, and doe iuſtly ſuſpect, that many of their priuate letters are publiſhed without their conſent and priuitie. I there meet alſo the names of diuers me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of eminent learning and wiſdome; and therefore it doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce me to perſwade my ſelfe that you haue beene ouerbold to ſubſcribe them, when I compare with their worth &amp; gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitie, your intolerable ridiculous arrogancie in an vnknowne fabrication, which when knowne (for ought is as is yet knowne) may hereafter proue a trifle, if not worſe. I doe not ſay ſo, but if it be ſo, truſt not too much vnto praiſes, which conſiſt in others gift and prodigalitie, but in true vertue, ſtanding by it ſelfe. I doubt it not, nor thinke it impoſſible, that ſome of your inſerted letters are permitted by the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors in diriſion of your boundleſſe inſolency, if with their allowance printed.</p>

The author of this teſtimony telleth vs, that the firſt remedies, namely purging, bleeding, vomiting, were ſo farre from giuing eaſe, that the diſeaſe and accidents grew worſe. After the taking of <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> there was a remiſſion of paine, the ſpirits were comforted,

                  <hi>Markes</hi> his reaſon vaine and weake, by which he would extoll <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> and depreſſe the praiſe and worth of the other remedies, ſo will I next proue manifeſtly and briefly, that he himſelfe and his <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> were ignorant and iniurious vnto the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, in intetrupting, and cauſing to be diſcontinued ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptly, purgation and Phlebotomie, howſoeuer after their vſe, the diſeaſe and accidents grew worſe.</p>
               <p>I dare not encounter ſo learned a Clarke without a Syllo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſme, thus then I reaſon.

               <p>But in the fore-mentioned diſeaſe of the named Gent. in in this teſtimony, the ſame reaſon and cauſe did ſtill remaine the ſame of phlebotomie and purgation: <hi>Ergo</hi> phlebotomie and purgation ought not to haue been diſcontinued, although the diſeaſe and accidents grew worſe.

Thus the Minor appeareth to be the Parſon his owne, and the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ior his great Maſters, for ſo forſooth he profeſſeth <hi>Hyppocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tes</hi>
                  <pb n="49" facs="tcp:17643:31"/> in the Engliſh Copie of this teſtimonie. As he cannot for ſhame denie himſelfe in the one, ſo can he not be ſo perfidious in the other, as to deny his Maſter. The concluſion therefore doth ſtand inviolat and infallible. The Syllogiſme is legall &amp; regular in the ſecond figure, and couched in <hi>Cameſtres.</hi> I doe now therefore boldly proclaime and divulge with authority, reaſon, rule, and manifeſt proofe, that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Markes</hi> in this te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimonie is an ignorant vndertaker, that his inſinuation into the Patient by <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> (howſoeuer pleaſing his eaſe) was iniurious and vnſeaſonable, that the generall remedies before-mentioned and adminiſtred by D. <hi>Co.</hi> (howſoeuer by the Parſon ſleighted and vilified) were in art and reaſon more proper, pertinent and materiall vnto the Patients health and recoverie, if vntimely they had not by <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> and by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Markes</hi> his vnlearned intruſion, beene diſcontinued. Here haply the Parſon will obiect: If there were ſo manifeſt a reaſon of iterated phlebotomie and purgation, why did D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>C.</hi> omit when he did phlebotomize and purge, to doe it vnto a more ſufficient module and meaſure? Why did not he thereby prevent the vſe of ſuch iteration in his adminiſtration thereof? Vnderſtand (worthy Reader) that M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Markes</hi> had purged and let blood the Patient before D. <hi>Co.</hi> came vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, and was alſo gone from him. The quantities which he had evacuated in either kinde, being vnto D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Co.</hi> vnknowne, diſcretion impoſed a caution vpon him, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forme that which remained, rather vnder then ouer compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. The reformation of this ſafe &amp; needful error, afterward the immediat abrupt ſucceeding of <hi>Auru<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> potabile</hi> did furiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly kick at, &amp; reiect. How neceſſary it was at that time to haue bene done againe, is before proued, &amp; the truth therof is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by the following imperfect <hi>Criſis,</hi> through the defect thereof, &amp; by the plentifull decumbence of humors, &amp; painful ſwellings of the nether parts (wherof is neither want nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcurity of witneſſes) as alſo by the patients long continuance languiſhingly ſicke the ſpace of halfe an yeare together, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding,
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:17643:32"/> the faire eaſe and pleaſure done by <hi>Aurum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile.</hi> His languiſhing ſo long is euident, reckning from D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. his departure from the patient in March going before, vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the date of this teſtimony September 10. after which time he was not as yet fully recouered ſaith this teſtimonie. The Parſon may haply as yet obiect farther. The ſtrength of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was not able to beare or indure the iteration of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer remedies when <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> came with his ſuccor and refreſhing. The contrary hereto did offer it ſelfe vnto euery vulgar and common eye. For it is vndoubted in common ſenſe and reaſon, that the ſame ability which was ſufficient to endure that expreſſed tedious &amp; painefull length of a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing ſickneſſe, by the vnperfect <hi>Criſis</hi> ariſing from the imperfect euacuations, and of the dangerous decumbence of humours, perpetually vexing and launcing the neather parts with perpetuall feare and doubt, It is vndoubted (I ſay) that this ſtrength might haue better indured a moderate evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in ſhort time done with facility, and without difficultie, or danger. The likely good reaſon and vſe of ſuch evacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, the words of this teſtimony doe offer apparent, that is a burning feauer, continuall eſtuation, burning, boyling, all want of reſt and ſleepe in the Gentleman; inward flame, or inflammation by theſe words in the Latine copie expreſſed, <hi>Ardens febris, Aeſtus continuus, flagratio, incendium.</hi> Vnto theſe we might adde (though not here mentioned) a pletho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricall body, vrine red intenſe, thicke, troubled. As theſe were manifeſt reaſons &amp; cauſes, mouing, and vrging phlebotomie and purgation, ſo that theſe ſtill remained the ſame after their ſecond vſe, beſides their firſt knowne moderation, and ſmall quantitie, it is euident by theſe words in the firſt teſtimonie before mentioned, <hi>Ne<expan>

It may here haply be obiected and imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:17643:32"/> that without <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> giuing ſtrength and refre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing, the patient could not haue endured either the langui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhing long ſickneſſe (as he did) nor the iteration of any the former generall remedies, if they had beene continued. If this be granted, yet doth it not excuſe his fowle errour and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, who becauſe <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> did giue this comfort &amp; abilitie, therefore he perverſly and ignorantly reiected other remedies, no leſſe neceſſary in other kinds, as was this in that. Neither is it to be doubted that if <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> were able to inable nature, to indure the terrour and torment of the fore mentioned languiſhing ſickneſſe, but that in reaſon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther remedies of the ſame kinde, and of the ſame created vſe, might haue done the ſame, howſoeuer at this time, and in this particular <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> alone hapned to be acceptable, &amp; therefore had the oportunity ſolely vnto it ſelf. It may haply yet be further enquired what manifeſt indication there was of vomit before mentioned. I need not giue thereof any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reaſon, then that inſeparable accident or ſymptome of a burning feauer; namely the exceſſiue ebullition of putrified choler abounding in the ſtomacke and liuer, which was in this patient manifeſt, accompanied with that ſtoppage of the backe and kidneyes, by the Parſon witneſſed, which did indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate that revulſion and deriuation, which vſually and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſtly vomit doth performe. The Parſon will haply as yet reply. If phlebotomie and purgation were ſo needfull to bee againe iterated, why did not the other learned, and worthie ſucceeding Doctors inſiſt in that courſe? The anſwer is two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold. Firſt I doe by my owne proofe and experience knowe, that the hope of their preualence therein againſt <hi>Aurum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> and his preiudicate anticipation, was impoſſible. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, I knowe it manifeſt, and out of doubt, that the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from the ſharpneſſe of the diſeaſe, and the ſetling of humours, and their decumbence into the neather parts, or at leaſt their irreuocable entrance into the way of decumbence, before the other two Doctors comming, did deny vnto them
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:17643:33"/> the opportunity of the vſe of thoſe remedies, their ſeaſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by delaying now paſſed, and a new indication offering a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother and different counſell through <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> his preoccupation, and tyrannous vſurpation of their due time and ſeaſon. The parſon may as yet moue a doubt, whether <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> be not in it ſelfe able to ſupply the vſe of purgation and phlebotomy? The contrar hereto is manifeſt, firſt by the proofe and triall thereof made, wherein by his owne teſtimony it is euident, that after the forſaking of the former remedies of phlebotomy and purgat on, and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herence vnto <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> there immediatly followed a plentifull decumbence of humours, ſwelling and poſſeſſing diuers parts, a long &amp; languiſhing time. Secondly, that <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum potabile</hi> cannot be able to performe or ſupply the vſe of the former remedies, is euident, for that no particular medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine of what vniuerſality ſoeuer, hath euer as yet been found by experience, or knowne by reaſon, to drawe the bloud ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiuely, or immediatly, in the proper maſſe &amp; ſubſtance from the ſeuerall fit veines. For this cauſe therefore, where the maſſe and ſubſtance of the blood is either corrupted, or is growne an importable burden vnto nature, <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> can neither certainely, nor ſpeedily (as is oft requiſite) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moue it, or euacuate it. Concerning purgation alſo, ſince it is manifeſt that the purgatiue vertue, or quality, is a proper, certaine, immediate, and ordinary operation of ſuch things as are in their true nature purgatiues; <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> except, proued among the kinde and nature of purgatiues (which cannot agree with the nature of ſo perfect and abſolute cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diall) cannot, nor doth not in it ſelfe purge or euacuate. It may be obiected, how came it then to paſſe, that in this Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman it is ſaid to purge ſo eaſily, pleaſantly and plentifully? Hereto we anſwer, that this purging iſſued not from any cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine, or ordinary property in <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> though then, or at ſome other times it may ſo happen thereto. For while <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> haply as a Cordiall, diſpelled from the heart
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:17643:33"/> offenſiue humours, ſome of them it is likely, through their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance, might fall into the common ſinke or paſſage, and ſo by accident be purged away; but this kinde of purging is vncertaine, doubtfull, and not equally, according to vſe and neceſſity, ſufficient againſt the fulneſſe and turgeſcence of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, which vnto a certaine module and meaſure require their certaine remoueall and euacuation. That <hi>Aurum pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> hath properly his place among Cordialls, both all gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall deſcriptions, and alſo the Apologiſt his owne particular confeſſion in many places doth proue. And thus obiections ſatisfied, the fixed manifeſtation remaineth of M. Parſons ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance in this teſtimony, as alſo his inſolence in vnderta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king aboue his reach, prowdly daring beyond his ſtation, without any likelyhood or liuelyhood of performance. How void he is of true iudgement herein, as alſo of any liuely ſap of true learning, the demonſtration hath not beene obſcure. Now as his preſumption in his ſuppoſed learning, overda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring beyond the ſlender muſcles, is fowly fallen vnto the ground: ſo let vs view his vnneceſſary, vnhoneſt, vnciuill, and crafty dealing, which hath ſolely miniſtred the matter, &amp; oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of all the ſcandall. Let mee put you in minde M. Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that the Gentleman mentioned was firſt your patient. You had purged him and once let him blood before D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. came vnto him, and were gone from him. After D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. was come, had againe purged him, vomited, and once more let him blood (the ſuppoſed doubt and feare of thoſe remedies being paſt) you then ſecretly came vnto him againe, ſecretly communed, and gaue vnto him <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> were you not herein a Fox? <hi>Non redoles ſed oles:</hi> It is no borrowed ſmell, it is your owne rancke ſauour. Let me yet farther tell you, that after <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> was thus ſecretly giuen by Maſter <hi>Markes</hi> vnto the patient, immediatly the patient, together with his wife (contrary vnto their former courteous and friendly vſage of D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. before, in his many fortunate imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments amongſt them many yeares together) now accuſe him
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:17643:34"/> vnto his face of erroneous iudging and practiſing in this one particular, with conſtant aſſeueration, that this aſſertion was auouched by ſome, both honeſt and learned, whom they would not name. No other reputed learned, or any Phyſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an, but M. <hi>Markes</hi> his marked ſelfe, had as yet beene with them. Thus remarkable was M. <hi>Markes</hi> his ſecond ſecret vndertaking and returne vnto the patient. Let me yet once more rub your galled memory. When vpon the former iuſt reaſon of ſuſpition D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. did write vnto M. <hi>Markes,</hi> requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him to iuſtifie, or denie with the patient the former im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, his anſwere was by letter (the coppy whereof is to be ſeene at the end of the confutation of this teſtimony) his anſwere (I ſay) was that in his vnderſtanding D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded according vnto art and reaſon, as are his own expreſſe words. If M. <hi>Markes</hi> bee an honeſt and plaine dealing man, let him reconcile that letter with this teſtimony. The letter profeſſeth D. C. his counſell and indeauours with the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned Gent. to haue beene according to art and reaſon. This teſtimony attributeth altogether vnto <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> &amp; extenuateth, caſteth behinde, or rather accuſeth the meanes and remedies by D. C. adminiſtred, as after which the diſeaſe grew worſe. Your meaning herein (M. <hi>Markes</hi>) is plaine, but plaineneſſe was not your meaning. If you did diſſemble in your writing vnto D. C. it was very vnhoneſt and puſillani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous. If you therein did not diſſemble, why doe you here oppoſe that which you then did write? Your oppoſition is manifeſt; firſt, in making your ſelfe in the Apologie, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taine and leader vnto the contradictory Epiſtles of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen: Secondly, by the ſame ſong or <hi>Paean,</hi> which perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally in all places you ſing vnto the ptaiſe of your <hi>Aurum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile:</hi> Thirdly, by your divulging the Apologie in my know<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ledge, wherein againſt your former letter, and your profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on therein, you haue conſented and concurred with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen in the publiſhing of their deceaued teſtimonies, vnto the preiudice of D. C. his good deſerts, and better meriting
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:17643:34"/> at their hands, acknowledged by your owne writing. Laſtly, your contrary affection and oppoſition vnto your former letter and profeſſion, is manifeſt by your euer ſince continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cuſtome &amp; practiſe of the ſame abuſe in all places of your acceſſe, for the venting and glory of <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> peruer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting thereby the cures of all other men by what other meanes ſoeuer, while by the inſinuation of ſupreame felicity therein, you ſwallowe vp time and opportunity, diſcreet reſpect or care of all other mature or due counſell in any other kinde. <hi>Plato</hi> and <hi>Ariſtotle</hi> haue taught you better diuinity. As for humanity, this your practiſe doth proue you neuer educate thereto, nor touched therewith. Touching your three-fold learning, your treble profeſſion, of a Phyſitian, a Chymiſt, a Diuine.

For you ſhall vnderſtand that about a twelue moneths ſince, I came to a brother-in-lawes houſe of mine, one S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>W. S.</hi> Knight in Northamptonſhire, whom I found in great extremitie of ſicknes, and thereby ſo weakned with the continuall torments he was in, that all which were about him feared him greatly. He had three Doctors in Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicke, yet could none of them miniſter any thing to him, to giue him any eaſe of his torments, but rather tormented him more; vntill at laſt himſelfe remembred that one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

                  <pb n="60" facs="tcp:17643:37"/> had commended this memorable medicine of yours, which being brought, he tooke it, and it wrought ſo miraculous an effect within the compaſſe of two houres, as neither he or I euer ſaw before. For it inſtantly deliuered him of his paine, which ſeemed before intolerable. It gaue him reſt, which for many dayes and nights before he had bene barred of. It drew on an appetite by little and little, all meate before being loth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome vnto him. And which is moſt marvailous, whereas for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly by his medicines excoriating thoſe paſſages, he ſeemed to endure great torture vpon euery provocation to the ſtools he had now in the day and night fiue ſtooles, and euery pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation was now as delightfull vnto him, as the other were tormenting. Then did one of his Phyſitians adviſe, that now he ſhould take ſome Cordiall, to aſſiſt the faculties of nature, being very weake. But when this was propounded vnto my brother by his wife, he vtterly refuſed it, the Phyſitian bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring him in hand, that it was nothing els but Vnicornes horne, Bezoar ſtone, and ſuch like. But after taking thereof, my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fell againe into his former tortures, and more vehement then before, whereby he was inforced the ſelfe-ſame night to ſend againe vnto M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Markes,</hi> who relieued him, as formerly he had done. Since which time (by Gods bleſſing) he hath continued well. After this manner an obſtructed bodie was cured.

               <head>The refutation of the ſecond Teſtimony.</head>
               <p>IT may be wondred (gentle Reader) that gentlemen of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted worth and vnderſtanding, ſhould ſo much diſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage their owne eſteeme, as in a profeſſion or facultie, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in they themſelues are neither inabled, or in reaſon or deco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum allowed, ſhould be ſo confident as to oppoſe publiquely their private opinion againſt any man in his own Art, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he profeſſeth, &amp; is able to proue by infallible knowledge &amp; demonſtration, and hath daylie proofe and excerciſe thereof. The reaſon hereof (as I friendly in the behalfe of the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with good reaſon interprete) was their kinde truſt vnto the broken reed of <hi>Markes</hi> his ſhivered learning, and his iuggling tranſportation thereby, of their imaginations, tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row the flattering momentanie eaſe and pleaſing, found in <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> As therfore I haue in the refutation of <hi>Marks</hi> his teſtimonie, giuen demonſtration of his ignorance therein, ſo will I in theſe teſtimonies, declare their errors and miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king; from him, not intending the men, but the matter, nor purpoſing their offence, but my owne iuſt defence. In this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond teſtimony, firſt view (good Reader) how confidently it avoucheth an excoriation of the paſſages by other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines, before <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> came. The qualitie of the medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines were vnknowne vnto them, whether carrying any poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibilitie of any ſuch effect in their nature and cuſtome. As for the ſuppoſed effect and excoriation it ſelfe, reaſon did giue no demonſtration thereof, and therefore they cannot affirme it from any knowledge or certaintie. The outward ſenſe could thereof giue no teſtimony, becauſe it cannot pierce into the inward and hidden paſſages within. Likelyhood or probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litie
<pb n="62" facs="tcp:17643:38"/> thereof, artificial coniecture could not afford vnto them, becauſe Art is not ſubiect vnto them, nor within their reach. And therefore without probabilitie they publiſh bare confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and their owne conceipt. Now (worthy Reader) ſee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine, how affection tranſporting without iudgement, doth offer manifeſt contradictions vnto it ſelfe. Here it is ſaid, that after the giuing of <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> the Patient was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atly refreſhed, and his obſtructed bodie from that time cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. This appeareth manifeſtly contradicted by M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                  <hi>Markes</hi> his teſtimonie, who ſaith, that after <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> (which was giuen in March) the Gentleman continued grievouſly ſicke vntill the 10. of September following, and after that time. Another contradiction like this, obſerue here alſo. Three Doctors of Phyſick could not miniſter any thing to giue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the patient eaſe (ſaith this teſtimonie.) Obſerue (worthy Reader) the incongruity hereof. The one of theſe three Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors was D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. (ſo by them ſtiled.) The other two ſuccee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded after him, that is, the ſecond vpon D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. his point of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture; the third after it. <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> was giuen vnto the Patient while as yet D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. was preſent, as appeareth by the third teſtimonie, where it was ſaid, that after D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. was gone vnto his reſt, the Patient in the night did ſend vnto M. <hi>Markes</hi> for <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> After the receiuing of this <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum potabile,</hi> ſaith this teſtimonie, the Patient was relieued as formerly, ſince which time, by Gods bleſſing, he hath con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued well. The third teſtimonie confirmeth the ſame, ſaying that immediatly after <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> the Patient found alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation, corroboration, and operation, as his ſoule would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire. If this be true, why are the two laſt Doctors accuſed for giuing no eaſe vnto the Patient. It appeareth that the Patient by their owne teſtimonies, had taken <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> before they came, and that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> had relieued him, corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borated and operated, as the Patients ſoule could deſire. If <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> had relieued him before, what neede or vſe was there to be expected of that office from the Phyſitians,
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:17643:38"/> and how iniuriouſly and vniuſtly are they taxed. Againe, if it were true, that after <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> the Patient was relieued, and continued after well, as ſaith this teſtimony, and had ſuch corroboration and operation thereby, as he could deſire (as faith the third teſtimonie) why did they then ſend after this profeſſed ſatisfaction, giuen firſt for the ſecond Doctor, and after for the third, after<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C. was gone? Any man may here ſee, how inconſiderate paſſion doth confute it ſelfe. Now once more (good Reader) obſerue the maine complaint and mone of theſe teſtimonies, namely forſooth, that the Gentleman had no eaſe ſo ſpeedily and promptly as he deſired. It is no wonder nor vnuſuall in ſick men, to find vncertaintie of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit and reliefe in remedies applied. Time, and their own pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, aſwell as medicines, doe worke therein. The ſick in the variation and interchange of many excellent medicines, fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth oft little eaſe, and ſometimes by hap in vnhoped, vnaffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cted, and vnexpected meanes, obtaineth preſent &amp; vnthought deliuery. It is not in the Phyſitians power alwayes to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, where God in his ſecret decree hath ſet and appointed the time, manner, or particular inſtrument of eaſe and deliue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance. That is vnto humane reaſon and vnderſtanding caſuall. His vpright and reaſonable indeavour, and not the felicity, or infelicity of the medicine, is the proper, true, and thank-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy merit. Neither is it the Phyſitians ſo proper office, ſo much to attend the Patients pleaſing eaſe, as to intend the cure of the diſeaſe. Many paines are neceſſarie, though grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous, and ſeeming vntollerable. If the patient ſhall be alwaies preſently pleaſed with eaſe, there ſhall neuer be Vomits giuen vnto ſicke men, nor purging adminiſtred, that ſhall grieue &amp; make weake the ſicke, nor ſhall any man be let blood vntill he faint, which in many and divers caſes is ſo neceſſary, that without it can be no life. In theſe caſes the Patient is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent iudge, nor ought floting fancie, wanting Art and true reaſon for Pylot, make ſenſe his card. That thou mayeſt more perfectly and infallibly know the partiall affection of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:17643:39"/> theſe teſtimonies (ingenious Reader) ſee here laſtly in this teſtimony, a needleſſe diligence and officiouſneſſe toward <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> in the oblique nomination of a learned, graue, and reverend Doctor vnto no vſe or purpoſe. In a great exigent of ſicknes forſooth, he did ſend from <hi>Oxford</hi> for <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> What is this unto the matter? In extremity of ſicknes, who knoweth not, that the moſt wiſe and learned that euer liued, doe oft-times want their free election and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion, being diſtracted by ſicknes, not only from their owne true worth, but from themſelues. It is not therefore materiall, whether the Doctor vpon his own ſuddaine moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or others mention, did ſend or invite this golden gueſt. The ſending doth not neceſſarily inferre the vſe; nor the vſe, the commendations: and whether the Doctor himſelfe doe attribute ought thereto, the blazers themſelues doe there doubt, as appeareth by their own words. That we may giue vnto them herein, compleate and vndoubted ſatisfaction; I will here inſert that worthy Doctor his owne anſwere vnto me therein, ſolicited by my letter therewith, crauing his iudi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious view of my reply vnto Doctor <hi>Anthony</hi> his falſe, iniu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, and ſcandalous Apologie. This is the true Copie of his Anſwere.</p>

                        </gap>rſality of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine is well and ſufficiently refuted by you. The efficacy thereof is ſet forth with ſuch words and commemoration of
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:17643:39"/> miraculous effects, as to a naturall Philoſopher and ſenſible Phiſitian, and to any iudicious perſon may ſeeme to ſurpaſſe humane reaſon. I thinke not that miracles are in theſe times ſo frequent and many of the propoſed examples are not ſo miraculous, as they ſeeme. For belike D. <hi>Anthony</hi> would haue vs beleeue, that who ſo hath taken of his <hi>Aurum potabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le</hi> and eſcaped death, eſcaped by the vertue &amp; efficacy there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. This is a fallacy, <hi>non cauſa pro cauſa.</hi> I purpoſe not now to examine other particular examples wherein his fallacies may be diſplayed, but becauſe I my ſelfe am brought in to be a ſpectacle in this ſtage, I would make it knowne both by word and writintg, hat I was ſicke 1612. as M. Hen. <hi>Skipwith</hi> writeth. I fell ſicke in the latter end of Auguſt. A ſemitertian ague poſſeſſed me, and grieuouſly afflicted me (as the condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it is) with faintneſſe and weakneſſe, beſides other acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents vſuall to agues as lothſomneſſe and diſtaſt of all kind of meats and drinks, vomiting, vnequall &amp; greiuous diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, loſſe of ſleepe, ſuppreſſion of vrine, lightneſſe of head in the heat of the fit. In time of ſome extaſie, or otherwiſe, vpon the famous mention and commendation which not long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I had heard S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>William Samwell</hi> knight, giue to <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> for preſent releiuing him in extreame faintneſſe, and qualifying his outragious diſtempers; I ſent my ſonne, or hee went to S<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>William Samwell</hi> for ſome of that medicine, and by his meanes to M. <hi>Markes:</hi> he got ſome for his money, and at that time alſo ſome of my friends procured ſome of it from D. <hi>Anthony.</hi> So I did take ſome of it twiſe, but (as God knoweth) with ſo little fruit, either of eaſe of my maladies, or cure of my ague, that their grieuouſneſſe increaſed many daies after, and continued from that time viz. 14<hi rend="sup">h</hi> September vntill the end of October, notwithſtanding all the ayd that many my good frends, as learned (in my iudgement) as Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctor <hi>Anthony,</hi> &amp; more learned in Phiſicke (I dare ſay) then M. <hi>Markes,</hi> could afford vnto me. I thanke God I recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red yet hardly and ſlowly. I maruell that M. <hi>Skipwith</hi> doth
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:17643:40"/> ſo confidently write, that my life and health is to be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to D. <hi>Anthonies</hi> medicine, ſeeing nether preſently I found any eaſe by it, nor in fortie dayes after any beginning of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couery or declination of my diſeaſe. And although the 20 of Ianuary following I was aliue, as M. <hi>Skipwith</hi> writeth, yet I was not well, as he auoucheth, for many impreſſions and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities of that ague did then ſticke grieuouſly in my body, and long time afterward, ſo that for the moſt part of the ſpring following, and of the next Autumne, I continually vſed Phiſicall rules. He notwithſtanding argueth thus. I did take <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> &amp; therefore thereby I recouered. This is an Elench and fallacious argument, ſuch as are many of thoſe which by teſtimonies are recited in D. <hi>Anthonies</hi> Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logie. Whereas M. <hi>Henry Skipwith</hi> ſaith, that I had partly ſeene, and partly heard the miraculous effects of this medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine. I haue often ſaid, and doe now proteſt, that I neuer yet did ſee any miraculous effect of it, except he will thus argue. I did ſee S. <hi>William Samwell,</hi> on whom it was thought to worke miraculouſly, therefore I did ſee the miraculous work and effect of this medicine. <hi>Elenchus eſt compoſitionis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Whereas the ſame Gentleman ſaith, that peraduenture I will not acknowledge that my recouery is to be imputed to this medicine: He calleth my good minde and thankfullneſſe towards God and man into queſtion, beyond any commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on knowne to me to be granted vnto him. And I confeſſe that in this duty of thankfulneſſe for Gods mercifull and bountifull bleſſings and benefits, as in other duties I haue beene and am defectiue. But I ſee no cauſe, why in writing &amp; in print I ſhould be noted and publiſhed faultie or ſuſpected, eſpecially in a matter which is rather put vpon me, then true in it ſelfe, and by them who can challenge no more ſinceritie and holineſſe to themſelues (for ought I knowe) then other men that liue vnder the burden and infection of humane co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. I did neuer giue to my remembrance, by word, wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, or vſage, occaſion of offence to M. <hi>Henry Skipwith,</hi> yet
<pb n="67" facs="tcp:17643:40"/> it ſeemeth that he had a minde to ſet vpon me particularly &amp; by name in the end of that his letter, when as couertly, and without name he had taxed, or rather wounded mee with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers without name in the fore part of it. S. <hi>William Samwell</hi> fel ſick about the end of March, or beginning of April, 1611. M. <hi>Markes</hi> was his firſt Phiſitian, and vſed remedies of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and phlebotomie, as appeareth by the anſwere to his letter the firſt domeſticall teſtimonie. D. C. being afterward ſent for, vſed his endeauour and conuenient remedies. M. <hi>Markes</hi> exhibited <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> once, and afterwards a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaine. Since that time, as M. <hi>Skipwiths</hi> words in his letter ſound, he continued well. It is then maruell that he ſent for D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Lapworth</hi> and for me. At D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Lapworths</hi> comming to him he was very ill before Whitſontide. At my comming to him after Whitſontide, he was ſomewhat relieued, but yet groa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning vnder the burthen of many infirmities, as alſo long time afterward. So that I ſee not how it might be iuſtly ſaid that he continued well after the twiſe taking of the <hi>Aurum pota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bile</hi> vnto the date of M. <hi>Skipwith</hi> his letter 1612, Ianuary 20. A ſaying more vniuſt is auouched in that letter, <hi>viz:</hi> that at M. <hi>Skipwiths</hi> comming to <hi>Vpton</hi> to viſit his brother in his extremity, hee had three Doctors with him. D<hi rend="sup">r.</hi> 
                        <hi>Lapworth</hi> came thither many daies after; and my comming was many daies after D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
                        <hi>Lapworth.</hi> And before our commings wee did not heare that any D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> of Phiſicke was there beſide D. <hi>Cotta.</hi> If any, or ſo many Doctors were there, it behoueth them to quit themſelues of this imputation, <hi>viz:</hi> that they tormen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the patient. D. C. hath anſwered ſufficiently for himſelfe. Oftentimes profitable medicines exaſperate the diſeaſe &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe paine for a while. <hi>Nulla remedia tam faciunt dolorem quam quae ſunt ſalutaria.</hi> If M. <hi>Markes</hi> was one of thoſe Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctors, he tormented firſt and healed afterwards. <hi>

After receauing thereof, within one houres ſpace, it is incredible to be ſpoken, what alleuiation I found of my languiſhing, and what corroboration of all my vitall, parts. In the morning I tooke it, and vntill night I felt a moſt happy operation there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of.

               <head>The Refutation of the third Teſtimony.</head>
               <p>THe maine in tent of this teſtimony is the praiſe and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> and the vilification of <hi>D<hi rend="sup">r</hi> C.</hi> his indeauour. <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> was proſperous, other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines were offenſiue and vnfortunate vnto the patients caſe. How then? Is this ſufficient ſimply to contemne the one, or exalt the other? Is this in true reaſon iuſtly to be exprobra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted againſt the Author or diſpenſer of the one, or truely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding worth vnto the Author of the other? Who is ignorant that the variation, election, or preferring by the Phiſitian of one medicine, rather then another of the ſame kinde, is euer as touching the euent vncertaine, and in euery ſmall circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance ſtill changeable and variable. The proofe alſo of true Sympathie betweene this or that medicine, and this or that particular perſon, conſiſteth in no certainty of infallible dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction founded vpon any vndeceauing or aſſured ground of
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:17643:42"/> art or rraſon, but vpon ſpeciall trialls thereof alone, and ſuch as are altered vpon euery change or differing circumſtance. For this cauſe in iuſt ballance weighed vnto art it ſelfe, or the Phiſitians merit or worth, there is nether praiſe due, when a medicine ſo giuen ſucceedeth weil, nor diſparagement deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved when it falleth out ill. Vnauoidable caſualtie of good or ill indifferently in theſe caſes is vſuall, and all men the moſt excellent, exquiſite, and ſcientificall that euer were are ſubiect thereto. No man whatſoeuer can foreſee the ſecret and hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſympathie, which that or this particular nature rather hath with this then that particular medicine. It is onely the long and oft obſerued proofe and triall that muſt giue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtration thereof. <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> in this patients ſenſe, in his Phiſitians profeſſion was a Cordiall. So was that which D. C. did adminiſter, and in many other bodies hath beene nothing inferiour vnto <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> euen to the vt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt extent of the praiſe and worth which the patient doth att<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ibute thereto. At this time, and in this Gentleman, it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened not to be fortunate, as was <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi> Is this ſufficient reaſon contemptibly to mention D. C. his meanes carefully and artificially applyed with good intention in himſelfe, and good indication in the diſeaſe and cauſe? Nay is this ſufficient matter to reuile, to hate D. C. to charge him him with loathed inſufficiency, openly and ſecretly to proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute him with all interiour malice. This is a ſecret I vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand not. It is here ſaid that D. C. was angrie ſorſooth, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his counſell was refuſed. Hee did neuer obtrude his cou<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ſell, nor would haue daigned it, if he could haue fore-ſeen ſuch inordinate and intemperate manner. If hee were angry, his anger was only for that the counſell, by which the patient had in reaſon receaued the firſt and maine good (as I haue proued in the confutation of the firſt teſtimony) was againſt reaſon ſo indignely forgot and vilified. For this cauſe hee did iuſtly diſdaine the vniuſt wrong, and did openly and profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſedly no leſſe readily refuſe, that he was refuſed in the view &amp;
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:17643:43"/> hearing of many witneſſes. Whereas it is ſaid that D. C. ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gered in his iudgement, and quailed in the hope of recouery. It was no more then occaſion did require, as may appeare firſt in the patients aduerſneſſe vnto himſelfe: Secondly, in <hi>Markes</hi> his deſcription of the patients eſtate, as alſo by the deliberation and pauſe which <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> did take for his imperfect recouery which was from D. C. his deſertion of the cure in March vnto the date of the firſt domeſticall te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtimony September 10<hi rend="sup">th</hi>. Whereas it is obiected that D. C. did write a booke inhumanely handling the patient with ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumnies. It is meere miſpriſion. The patient was neuer in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny treatiſe by him nominated nor ſo much as deſcribed in any ſuch ſort, as he can iuſtly any way appropriat vnto himſelfe. There was neuer any wrong really done vnto him, but onely in his owne opinion. What in any priuate ſpeech hath paſſed that might ſeeme to touch him, it was extorted and vnauoi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dable for the wronged his neceſſary and iuſt defenſe, being prouoked by all extremity of diſpite. As for the book which is tearmed vaine, it is able to anſwere for it ſelfe, and was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uer as yet put to ſilence. Now vnto the matter it ſelfe. It is doubted whether the patient be beholding vnto D. C. in any part for his care and precedent paines, or ſoly and totally vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> ſucceeding after. It doth not follow that becauſe <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> pleaſed the patient his eaſe, ſenſe and deſire; therefore it doth performe the reall true benefit in right vnderſtanding vnto the health. It were ridiculous if a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny man ſhould thus reaſon. This way is a faire way, a plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant greene way, pleaſeth and refreſheth me, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is my way home. This is a thorny, ragged, crooked way, and much troubleth and diſcontenteth me, <hi>Ergo,</hi> it is not the way vnto my intended iourney. The way vnto health is oft times as the way vnto heauen, ſmally pleaſing. It is not the pleaſures or refreſhing in the way, but the true end and expected iſſue thereof, which indueeth the iudicious with content, perſeue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and patience, to walke therein. In the right method of
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:17643:43"/> regular cure, and according vnto art and reaſon D. C. did proceed, by the confeſſion of M. <hi>Markes</hi> his letter going be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore at the end of the confutation of the ſecond teſtimonie. The truth thereof likewiſe doth proue it ſelfe by demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in the ſame fore-mentioned confutation. Common rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and the generall courſe and cuſtome of all Phiſitians in the like caſe or occaſion, doe vncontrouerſly confirme the ſame. How can it then be iuſt or reaſonable that D. C. gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding his honeſt intention, and care of the patients good, by true art, by likely reaſon, and in all artificiall order &amp; courſe confeſſed, ſhould notwithſtanding, bee blamed and blaſted with an euill breath, becauſe the preſent or ſpeedy euent was not according vnto expectation equally proſperous &amp; hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; or becauſe the patient thereby found not eaſe. What the diſeaſe was is apparent by <hi>Markes</hi> his deſcription, namely a burning feauer. The remedies in that diſeaſe euer requiſite &amp; neceſſary in ordinary regular cure, were by D. C. adminiſtred according vnto art and reaſon, as ſaith the ſame <hi>Markes.</hi> The Patient complaineth in this courſe, hee as yet found no eaſe,<note n="†" place="margin">Plethore v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicum ac pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

Since then after the vſe of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum potabile,</hi> plenty of humors ſtill remaine, afflicting and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſing divers parts, therefore manifeſtly <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> was, as inſufficient and defectiue in true and perfect cure, ſo alſo in due evacuation of humors, neceſſarily conductiue vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to cure. And thus doth manifeſt reaſon informe, that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> did vnſeaſonably intrude it ſelfe, and abruptly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued more reaſonable and neceſſary remedies. This hurt and iniurie, in reaſon <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> apertly committed, the only good it did, was reputed eaſe and refreſhing vnto the Patient. This is indeed a pleaſure and benefit in the <hi>interim,</hi> in cure, but no effecting, or effectuall perfecting of cure. Here may a queſtion be moued, whether we may not ſafely truſt Cordials (among which <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> is one) without phlebotomie or purgation, for the relieuing of nature, and cure of diſeaſes, conſidering many diſeaſes are ſeene to be ſo
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:17643:44"/> cured ſometimes. When diſeaſes thus happen to be cured, (which is very rare and ſeldome, and euer vncertaine) that it commeth by accident, and is caſuall, no man is ignorant. It is true, that after Cordials, Nature is found ſometimes inabled or ſtirred vnto many ſpontaneous expulſions, ſometimes by bleeding, ſometimes by vomiting, ſometimes by ſweat, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by purging, as in the aboue-named Gentleman, by his teſtimony of ſuch like effects, in his <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> may be haply granted. But we muſt obſerue and diſtinguiſh, when, and how, Nature is hereto accuſtomed, and inabled; as alſo when ſhe hath power, and when ſhe hath no power thereto. For where the cauſe of the diſeaſe is abſolute Lord or Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter ouer Nature; as touching her owne daring to encounter, or as touching her poſſibility to reſiſt, as alſo where ſhe doth vnto her vttermoſt, reſiſt and ſtriue in vaine, (for that the cauſes of diſeaſes, haue before gotten ſo ſtrong holdes with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in her, that ſhe can neuer raiſe or remoue them,) there the power of Nature is of no force by Cordials, nor can the moſt aſſiduous application of the moſt excellent Cordials prevaile, but are in all reaſon vainely obtruded, or at leaſt vſed for a ſhort time of ſlender releiuing only, except the<note n="*" place="margin">Ideo in valdè acutis purgan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dum, ait Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, eadem die ſi materia turgeat: d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But where the cauſe of the diſeaſe is not abſolute Lord or Maſter, but Nature is able in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree or ſort, to ſtruggle and contend therewith, there ſhe may be, and is, oft inabled by Cordials, ſometimes to put by the preſent fury and malignity of a diſeaſe, ſometimes to make an exchange of a more tollerable diſeaſe, for a more intollera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; a more dull, for a more ſharpe; a chronick, for a more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute: yet ſtill in theſe caſes, or for the moſt part, or vſually, ſhe remaineth a priſoner vnto diſeaſes, though haply ſeeming ſometimes, ſomewhat refreſhed, or enlarged, by exchange of

There onely ſolely and truely, Cordials do effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctually prevaile to good or benefit, where the diſeaſe is not in it ſelfe vnto Nature importable, nor in the cauſe, doth totally depreſſe and ſway her downe. For Cordials, although they doe manifeſtly repaire the decayed ſtrength of Nature, yet can they not giue vnto Nature ſtrength aboue that, which radically fundamentally, and originally ſhee before had, and poſſeſſed in her ſelfe. Nor can they inable her to beare any weight or loade of affection, aboue that<note n="*" place="margin">Ideo pleniorem habitum bonam ſtatim ſolvere monet Hippo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crates, tanquam periculoſum vai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dè.

            <p>NOw hauing declared the falſitie, and depraued end and vſe of ſome of your teſtimonies, beſt knowne vnto my ſelfe, I will next according vnto promiſe, recite other ſome, which in true reaſon, in Art, in the generall counſels, decrees, and experience of all Phyſitians, are infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and altogether void of credit, or poſſibility in themſelues.
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:17643:46"/> This is evident by your propoſing your curation of ſuch diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes as are incurable. See <hi>page 86.</hi> where you report your cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of a Maraſme, as ſaith your Latin Copie. Your Engliſh Copie <hi>page 94.</hi> ignorantly tranſlateth your word <hi>Maraſmus</hi> an extreame debility. We muſt needs take the Latin for the text, and the originall. The impoſſibility of curation of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſme,</hi> is evident vnto him who knoweth what <hi>Maraſmus</hi> is <hi>Galen</hi> in his booke <hi>de Marcore,</hi> doth teli you that it is <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptio corporis viventis propter ſiccitatem,</hi> that is, the currup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, waſting, or deſtruction of a liuing body, thorough dry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes, or privation of the radicall and life-giuing moiſture. <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſme</hi> is the higheſt degree of a conſummate conſumption. For this cauſe he ſaith in the ſame place, that it is incurable. <hi>Maraſmus omnes corporis partes ſimiliter abſumit. Attenua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tos verò ſanârunt, qui Maraſmum ſe ſanâſſe putârunt, circa affectionum genera errantes:</hi> that is, a <hi>Maraſme</hi> conſumeth all parts of the bodie alike.

Thus your affirmation of your curation of <hi>Maraſmus,</hi> doth appeare vnto all learned men, vnlearned, and not true. Concerning your reports of the curation of other kindes of conſumptions likewiſe, obſerue the weaknes, <hi>page 86</hi> of the Latin Copie, you avouch a man cured in few dayes, <hi>page 87</hi> of the Latin Copie, you report another cured <hi>breviſſime,</hi> that is, moſt ſpeedily. The Engliſh Copie, <hi>95 page,</hi> tranſlateth it ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morouſly, as doubting the Latin was too bold, and ill advi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed. Who knoweth not, that knoweth leaſt in Phyſick, that all conſumptions are Chronick, and bringing diſeaſes, and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, and vnavoidably requiring length of time vnto their

There augmented the former doubt and feare the preſence of a continuall feauer, the double Iaundes, the yellow, and the blacke. By one only medicine, contrary vnto all expectation, and againſt much oppoſition, I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly recouered her decayed power and ſtrength,<note place="margin">The Lady Coke of Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well Parke.</note> &amp; within an houre or two after the aſſumption thereof, ſhee was with gladſome facilitie deliuered, her child liuing vntill the next day, with very good likelyhood of continuance in life, being notwithſtanding borne twelue weekes before the time.

The Iaundes of both kindes was ſhortly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with wonder vnto the beholders cured, at which time alſo ſhee a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided from her guts a ſtone the bigneſſe of an haſle nutte, round, ſmooth, white, as hard as a flint, full of holes as if bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red through.</p>
            <p>Many yeares before the former ſucceſſe, I had made proof of the ſame medicine, but eſpecially in a vertuous Lad e dwelling two miles diſtant from Northampton weſtward. Shee had then beene diſtreſſed very neere the ſpace of a ſort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, in doubt of ſtrength and hopefull deliuery in child-bed. Within an houre, or thereabout, after the taking of the ſame medicine at my hand, earneſtly by her deſired againſt the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of other women preſent, ſhe ſenſibly recouered her loſt ſtrength, and obtained ſpeedily her wiſhed deliuerance of her liuing burden: I knowe not whether the Agents for
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:17643:50"/> 
               <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> may now haue preuailed to beget an obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, and extenuation of this and diuers other my willing &amp; fortunate endeauours in that familie.</p>
            <p>Vnto the third Curation by <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> and your boaſt therein, I doe oppoſe the wife of one <hi>Edward Owen,</hi> dwelling in the citty of Couentree; ſhe was vexed the ſpace of a weeke with the head of a dead childe, remaining in her wombe after the body was gone diuers dayes before. All o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meanes in vaine varied, this one medicine (when ſhe was almoſt ſpent and ready to yeeld the Ghoſt) gaue vnto her comfort and ſtrength, and within few howres after the recea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving thereof a ſpeedy deliuery of that dead part. She liued af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it two daies with ſome hope of recouery: but her former labour, paines, and toile, firſt with the firſt diuided part, and after with the ſecond, and the treble vexation and weakneſſe in the time of interim betweene the one and the other did de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priue her of that hope; the woman her ſelfe, notwithſtanding, being very thankfull and ioyfull of her receaued eaſe, and comfort without expectation of life.</p>
            <p>In Northampton this laſt paſſed yeare, the wiſe of one <hi>Maude,</hi> vexed by multitudes of other medicines, in vaine af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the receauing of this ſelfeſame medicine beyond all hope or opinion, within few houres was disburdened of her dead and before mangled burden, and ſuruiueth the miſery, and is now ſince that time againe with childe.</p>
            <p>Your wonders acted by <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> in the ſmall pox, I will paralell with as wonderfull iſſues by other medicines. It is now about tenne yeares paſt, ſince a poore man of Nor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thampton required my aduiſe concerning his child, being a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 4 or 5 yeares of age. She had beene partly by much for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Phiſicke, and partly by the long continuance of her diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe about halfe a yeare extreamely weake and macerate. I preſcribed only vnto her the aſſiduous vſe of <hi>Carduus bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictus</hi> boiled in poſſet drinke. After this drinke vſed two or three daies, the child did caſt forth an incredible number of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:17643:50"/> wormes, and after the wormes iſſued the ſmall pox plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. Thus was the childe perfectly, and inſtantly recouered, &amp; grew in ſtrength, bigneſſe, and feeding. For the praiſe and worth of this meane medicine ſenſibly vnto the childe it ſelfe, it is worthy the recording, that the child after the recouery, did take ſuch liking and loue vnto <hi>Carduus benedictus,</hi> that ſpontaneouſly and of the owne accord ſhe could cry and call for it, and greedily eat it ſometimes alone by it ſelfe in the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bitter ſubſtance.</p>
            <p>I will followe this cure of the ſmall poxe with another only, <hi>Anno</hi> 1601. A young Gentleman, my very worthie freind <hi>H. T.</hi> was dangerouſly ſurpriſed by the laſt mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned diſeaſe, vpon which after they were fully broken out, did freſhly againe ſtart out and creepe another kinde of poxe of a leſſe high colour. After the poxe were thus plentifully and doubly broken forth, and had ſpread and ſetled themſelues in euery part, beyond all poſſibility of returne backe againe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward (the Gentleman notwithſtanding ſtill continuing ſicke) I gaue vnto him an ordinary lenitiue. Before the receauing thereof, hee continued ſtill very ſicke and weake, vnable to moue, or to be moued out of his bed. After the firſt operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thereof, in the ſame inſtant, he was diſcharged of his ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe, continuall heat, the noiſome fume and ſmoak of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, and weariſomneſſe of his bed, and ſo perfectly and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently reduced vnto his former healthfull temper, that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diatly without my knowledge, hee aduentured downe into the houſe and aire, with the freſh heat and glowing of the poxe in his face. Notwithſtanding he did neuer after find any ſickneſſe, weakneſſe, or inconuenience at all therein, the freſh remembrance, or markes only of the poxe in his face, outfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the wonder. Here you may ſee what rare ſucceſſes may oftentimes happen vnto meane trifles and toyes in their vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar eſteeme, giuing occaſion of wonder vnto men, whoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectiue knowledge is vnable to check and limit the too much wandring of wondring.

            <p>Concerning Dropſies by <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> related in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pologie to haue beene vanquiſhed, I will bound my ſelfe (as in all the former) vnto the equalling them within two inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. A Gentlewoman of my name and family, hapned to bee ſuddenly and extreamly ſwollen in her belly, and extenuate in all other parts of her body except her legges. After three quarters of a yeare co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>tinuance in this eſtate, with ſome hope of child-birth, in the end finding her ſelfe deceaued, and like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe her midwiues, &amp; ſome alſo learned (able in as great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties to iudge and diſcerne) ſhe reſolued her ſelfe to be <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropicall.</hi> She did heare the counſell, &amp; had the conference of diuers worthy and learned Doctors, and Phiſitians, yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolued to be a patient to my ſelfe alone, &amp; yet ſo my patient, as to haue no further patience then with one onely medicine, and but once indured, or at moſt twiſe. After the receauing hereof without any moleſtation vnto her, the firſt day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in few houres all her humours and hydropicall ſwellings im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatly did fall, and ſhe hath euer ſince that day and time beene perfectly recouered, and ſo hath remained now 4 or 5 yeares. If <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> had effected this, it had beene chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicled as a wonder, but let <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> learne not to bee 100 ſwift vnto wonder. Every ordinary Phiſitian that hath the opportunity by any competence of practiſe to view the workes of nature, cannot chooſe but oft meet with many rare and wonderfull contingents. It behoueth a Phiſitian to make rather his vſe then his boaſt thereof. I affect not with
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:17643:51"/> the Apologiſt the indiſcreet publication of euery particular man and name. This report hath the teſtimony of learned Phiſitians, as concerning the diſeaſe, and of many neighbours in Northampton touching the forementioned effect.</p>
            <p>There was Patient vnto mee this laſt yeare, a very aged Gentleman, one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi> 
               <hi>Wiſeman,</hi> in his owne account more, in the common eſteeme of other men nothing leſſe, then foure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>skore yeares. I found him extreamely ſwelled in legs, thighs, back, belly, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>tomack, as largely as the skin was able to ſtretch and diſtend it ſelfe. His ſenſes were ſo benummed, that hee oftentimes did not (though being awake) take notice of vſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all or ordinary obiects. His ſleepes were vnquiet with groanes and ſtarting, his reſpiration very ſhort, thicke, and full of difficultie, his reaſon and memory very oft by fittes, and times forraking him. Hee very earneſtly deſired my preſence, and counſell. After my firſt view of him I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted, leauing him in my opinion (which was grounded vp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the occaſion, which his eſtate before deſcribed did yeeld) out of any likelyhood of helpe. I returned againe the ſecond time notwithſtanding, being againe ſolicited, and then I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred vnto him a tentatiue purge, hidden from his taſte or ſight in a little caudle. The effect thereof was admirable. All his ſwellings wholly deſcended from his vpper parts in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his legges and thighes, the extreame ſicknes of his ſtomack, ſhortnes of winde, and difficultie of breathing and ſuffocati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, departed; his outward and inward ſenſes returned perfect, and after the firſt operation of his purge by the vſual paſſage, he did alſo caſt vp by vomit at leaſt one pint of meere blood, without the mixture of the leaſt moytie of any other matter or humor, being an accident, which in al his life ne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

So perfect an alleviation, did ſo preſently follow the ſame alſo, that he found himſelfe in ſtrength and ability the ſame that he was in his former health, &amp; forſaking his Chamber, walked into his houſe after his wonted manner, the ſpace of a fortnight or three weekes, or thereabouts,
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:17643:52"/> complaining ſolely of his ſwelling in his legs. The mentioned time paſſed, he relapſed into the former dangerous eſtate: firſt deſcribed, and had the ſame deliuery with the ſame accidents, by the ſame medicine The third time he relapſed, and then diſcouraged with the ſhort ſtay of the two former alleviati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he demanded not helpe, and thus extreamely ſwelling in all parts, was ſoone ſuffocated. With his death, the rare and extraordinary operation of the medicine doth not die, nor is thereby obſcured, or iuſtly to be extenuated. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> this rare e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent or iſſue had fallen vnto the Apologiſt, he would haue de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated the memory thereof vnto the worſhip of <hi>Aurum po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabile,</hi> and his owne praiſe. I knowe this medicine excellent for the expulſion of hydropicall waters, or ſwellings: but vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to any neceſſary ſequele therefrom, of that evomition of blood, with ſuch ſwift and admirable alleviation and recove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thereby, from all the former euill accidents at once, inſtant and movent, I vaine-gloriouſly aſcribe nothing, being a thing that happened by accident, and without fore-knowledge or hope of ſuch event in the firſt intent thereof. I come now to offer vnto view the laſt paire of euidences, for the matching of other medicines, to be comparable with <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> and that is, in derelict and deplorate eſtates, as the Apologiſt hath termed it, <hi>Anno 1609.</hi> a noble and worthy Lady hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to be my Patient,<note place="margin">The Lady Clifton, wife vnto the Lord Clifton.</note> noble in true worth and vertue, wife vnto a Barron. Her diſeaſe was vnknowne, as vnto my ſelfe, ſo vnto many other her Phyſitians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but her danger was mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt vnto vs al. She was continually afflicted with a vehement palpitation of the heart, fainting, perpetuall want of reſt and ſleepe, and implacable paine and excruciation and anxietie in her ſtomack, as accidents and concomitants. When now in mine opinion, and in the decree of all the other learned and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verent Phyſitians (ſome being then preſent with her from <hi>Oxford,</hi> ſome from <hi>London</hi>) as alſo when in all likely reaſon, it was impoſſible with that fury &amp; vehemencie of her paines, ſhe ſhould ſurviue beyond one day at the moſt, not by any
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:17643:52"/> merit in my ſelfe, in my skill or better iudgment, but by Gods only goodnes, I did caſually happen to adminiſter vnto her, in way of variation and proofe, only a medicine procuring ſleep, which beyond my expectance in reaſon, happened to be ſo fortunate in the oft iterated vſe, as exceedeth credit. Vpon the firſt aſſumption thereof, ſhe did fall into a more then ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary ſound ſleep, from that euening, vntill the next morning. In the morning ſhe awaked free from all paine and ill acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents, ſo continuing the ſpace of a weeke together, being all that <hi>interim</hi> able to ride &amp; walke abroad to viſit her friends, ſomtimes in a calme euening to take the aire in her Coach, without any noted ſenſe or complaint of the former accidents or paine. After a few dayes of this Halcyonian tranquillity and eaſe, the violence and fury of her paines vſually againe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, vntill the ſame medicine required and receiued, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the ſelfe-ſame effect, which in this manner at the ſame times it failed not to do conſtantly almoſt a quarter of a yeere by continued courſes or viciſſitudes. In this manner was ſhee admirably preſerued aliue ſo long ſpace. After that time paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, it then failed, and loſt his former vertue and wont, and then within few dayes, the intollerable crueltie and fiercenes of paine, made an end of her dayes. There are divers Ladies and Gentlewomen in Northampton-ſhire witneſſes hereof. This example of the manifeſt, excellent power and efficacy of a medicine, in ſuch an eſtate, by ſo many iterations appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, is not eaſily paralleled. I do not notwithſtanding with the Apologiſt, exalt it aboue meaſure, nor arrogate vnto my ſelfe thereby beyond others, nor depraue other men or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines in the pride thereof, nor impute vnto it aboue reaſon, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membring the ſage counſell of <hi>Hippocrates, lib. 2. Aphoriſ. 27.</hi> not to truſt, or relie, or giue too much credit or honour vnto medicines or diſeaſes, that for a time, or without reaſon do giue refreſhing.</p>
            <p>The yeare 1615. by a very worthy noble Knight in Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fordſhire, I was required to viſit his ſicke daughter,<note place="margin">Sir Richard Chetwood.</note> who ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:17643:53"/> bene divers dayes vexed with a feauer, in the end was ſuddainly deprived of all her inward and outward ſenſes, and in that ſhape of death, continued 42 houres, both ſpeechleſſe and ſenſeleſſe. Her recovery, before my comming, by her Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents and friends as a thing impoſſible, was not ſo much as i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>magined, but her graue intended. That remedie which hath bene formerly mentioned, to relieue in danger and difficultie of childbirth, and in expulſion of the dead infant, firſt revived her, and after reſtored her by the grace of God vnto her per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect health, other meanes only concurring, to remoue the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crudeſcence of her feaver.</p>
            <p>Thus in that number which cannot be leſſe, nor for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, needeth to be more, that is, in a duality of inſtances in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uery particular (which is ſufficient for demonſtration, though haply not for oſtentation) I haue manifeſted that other medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines are equall vnto <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> his beſt perfections and performances, as alſo that although in pride and preſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons predication, it may ſeeme ſuperiour, yet in true proofe &amp; practice, other remedies in the bl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſſing of God, and their own ſpecificall vertues, are nothing inferiour. This advantage only <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> may haply haue, that when the cauſe of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes hath bene firſt by other remedies remoued, or at leaſt qualified, it remaining alwayes, or for the moſt part behind, as the <hi>Vltimum refugium,</hi> the laſt hope or refuge (as I obſerue by the current of the whole Apologie) where Nature beyond all hope of ſenſe, is now left, derelict, and without hope (as it oft falleth out) and yet inſenſibly doth recollect her ſelfe by little and little, as is oft ſeene, and is vſuall, when at ſuch times ſhe is alſo eaſily raiſed and helped by any meane Cordiall or corroboratiue) there <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> may alone (being left alone) participate with nature in the praiſe of her own work. And thus gold, the common obiect of a theefe, is herein a theefe it ſelfe, and robbeth Nature of hir own right. As for Natures reliefe therein, or thereby, in the ſame manner other meane medicines in like ſort vſed, haue likewiſe oft times as
<pb n="93" facs="tcp:17643:53"/> well performed. In both, the true praiſe in the happy ſucceſſe is only due to God, and not to either inſtrument.</p>

It is, I ſay, now 8 or 9 yeares ſince he was priſoner or captiue vnto an immedicable dropſie. He was by ſome frends perſwaded vnto <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> as vnto the ſole ſacred an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor of remaining hope.

It may be haply replyed, that this was a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorate diſeaſe, and therefore death was no more then was expected, as the Apologiſt doth in ſome places giue vs to conſider thereof. But we could giue him alſo to conſider a little further, <hi>viz.</hi> that in deplorate diſeaſes, it is againſt Art to defame any noble remedy, as<note n="*" place="margin">De Meth.

If good hap could here haue wrought impoſſibility of life vnto poſſible, or could haue caſt death out of poſſeſſion, then had the attempt thereof bene vſefull and commendable, but not to diſtinguiſh where and when, vſeleſly, and vſefully within or without the latitude of hope, or the <hi>poſſe</hi> of contingence, to adminiſter the moſt excellent remedies whatſoeuer, is certain and infallible teſtimony and evidence of want of true iudg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Art and prudence.</p>
            <p>It was reported, in my hearing, to the reuerend Doctor mentioned in the ſecond domeſticall teſtimony, by one M<hi rend="sup">r</hi>

            <p>It is now 3 or 4 yeares ſince an old Gentleman of great eſtate and wealth, dwelling at <hi>Billing</hi> in Northamptonſhire,<note place="margin">M.

He had before vſed <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> by the aduiſe and direction of a<note place="margin">M. Markes.</note> grand diſpenſer thereof, whom I found preſent with him. Hee did not onely finde no eaſe or benefit thereby, but (as he ſaid himſelfe oft in the frequent hearing of diuers witneſſes) ſuch diſtemper, heat, and offenſe, that conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually afterwards the ſpace of two or three yeares together, vpon any light occaſion, he would fall into ſuch deteſtations, execrations, and impatience with the very mention thereof, that it was a very difficult matter ſodenly to pacifie his cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler.

            <p>AFter the Apologiſt his teſtimonies at large gloriouſly diſplayed, he muſtereth vp againe, and offereth a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>view of al his paſſed poſitio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>s in the Apology, adding with a faire floriſh a proclamation of his defence of truth, of charity, of loue &amp; care of humane kind, &amp; the health of man. I will therefore now diſmantle the face of his iugling &amp; cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumuention, by the manifeſtation, firſt of his owne contradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of himſelfe therein: ſecondly, of his apparant falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, in his counterfeit profeſſion of truth. Concerning his contradictions, read page 111, of the engliſh. Thus you ſay, Let Electuaries, Syrrupes, Pills, Powders, remaine, &amp; retaine their account and worth by long time and experience appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Reconcile this with the page 106, where in skorne you

Reconcile alſo thoſe words page 103, of the Latine copie left out in the Engliſh, with the page 120 of the Engliſh. In the firſt named place you ſay <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> reſiſteth all diſeaſes by what name ſoeuer called, and remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ueth the antecedent cauſes by conuenient naturall paſſages. In the ſecond place you ſay that in a repleat body euacuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is neceſſary by purging to be had, as alſo that blood-let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in conuenient time is not to be neglected. See your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and contradiction herein. If you ſpeake truth in the firſt place that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> remoueth the antecedent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of diſeaſes, that which you ſay in the ſecond place is falſe, friuolous, &amp; needleſſe; namely that there is neceſſity of pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation or phlebotomie for that purpoſe page 101 of the La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine copie, againe read: In our countrey (ſay you) <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> mixt with wine is ſufficient without any other mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or addition in all diſeaſes. A few lines after this you ſay in the ſame place of the Latin copie; Notwithſtanding where the aire is intemperate, or the diſcretion of the Phiſitian, or the neceſſity of the perſon ſhall perſwade it may be tempered with fit and proper waters. See your folly &amp; contradiction. If there be a fitneſſe and property in the waters (as you here confeſſe) then is not the mixture of <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> with the<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> arbitrarie (as before you ſaid) but neceſſary. If it be neceſſary then is not <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> ſufficient by it ſelfe, or in wine a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone. Thus much concerning your contradictions. Now let vs view your manifeſt falſhoods. Read page 97 before me<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, namely <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> neuer did hurt.

Vnto the ſame diſtinction in the antecedent cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, the general voice of all Phiſitians doth ſubſcribe by thoſe tearmes of <hi>Plethora</hi> and <hi>Cacochymia.

The matter or humour in the body which neceſſarily goeth before the diſeaſe, is there congregated in more or leſſe quantity, and either within the veines or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out. From within the veines to the outward ſenſe Phleboto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mie doth immediatly manifeſt it ſelfe to euacuate. From the other paſſages, purgation is by the eye witneſſed directly to draw. For this cauſe Purgation and Phlebotomie are called generall remedies, becauſe in all diſeaſes generally they doe manifeſtly euocate the humours or ſuperfluities, whereof all diſeaſes doe euer breed. Now examine your <hi>Aurum potabile.</hi>
               <pb n="102" facs="tcp:17643:58"/> Is it poſſibly ſufficiently to remoue the antecedent cauſes of diſeaſes, as you report thereof, without diſtinction? If it bee hereto ſufficient, then it muſt ſo be either in it ſelfe ſimply, or by accident. Simply nothing can bee ſufficient or effectuall thereto, except thoſe things which haue a purgatiue nature or quality. If it include ſuch a property or quality in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture thereof, then it is not ſimply and truely a Cordiall: &amp; if not ſimply and truely a Cordiall, then is it inferiour, and n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t to be compared with many other things, which are truely, meerely, ſolely Cordialls, corroboratiues, and comforters of nature, without any mixture with another nature different and aduerſe thereto as all purges are. If you ſay that your <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> doth by accident remoue the antecedent cauſe of diſeaſes, then is it no way equall, or to be compared with Phlebotomie or Purgation, which alwaies doe certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, immediatly, manifeſtly, ſpeedily, and promptly euacuate ſuperfluities, which euer are, and euer were the antecedent cauſes of diſeaſes, as is aboue ſaid. That which is, or happe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth only by accident is caſuall and vncertaine, nor can there be therein any certainty, truſt, aſſurance, or neceſſary expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctation. And thus your leuitie, your fallacy, your inſidiation, and inſinuation into credulous mindes, by confuſed and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biguous pronunciatiues doth detect it ſelfe. How vainely, &amp; falſely therefore you make <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> his inſufficiency ſufficient in the remoueall of antecedent cauſes, is moſt cleare and euident. The danger hereof alſo is as evident, while men in their neceſſitie<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

Another manifeſt falſhood is page 106. where you ſay, that you doe impoſe or
<pb n="103" facs="tcp:17643:58"/> preſcribe nothing againſt reaſon, whereas in all your former propoſed proofes in your Apologie, you haue not produced any one ſolide or ſubſtantiall rea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>on among them all. Equall vnto this is that page 94. of the Latin copie alone, where you proclaime <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> availeable in deplorate diſeaſes; &amp; where all humane helpe is denied. This muſt neceſſarily be an Hyperbole, or a lie. It is not materiall which it be. I will not heere tell you, that D. <hi>Anthony</hi> doth contradict you herein, page 97. Latine Copie, where he ſaith (if you do remember or marke the place) that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> in derelict or mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tall diſeaſes can do no good. The laſt falſhood, or rather that which I haue reſerued vnto the laſt, is the great mother of all the reſt, namely your counterfeit profeſſion of trueth, of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, ſimplicity, ſimple truth, which you predicate, page 109. and 94. Latin copie, likewiſe your profeſſion of contempt of fame or glory, page 61. Engliſh copie; Is it contempt of glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to proclaime, that God would haue you alone honoured with this great ſecret, which you do expreſſely in your Latin Preface? Is it contempt of glory to publiſh, that the hand of God doth miraculouſly aboue all other created medicines, worke by your <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> as you doe page 91. of the Latin copie? Is it contempt of glory to ranke your medicine next vnto God, as aboue all other, the moſt preſent ſuccour from God, which in expreſſe words you do page 55. Latine copie? The excellencie of the workmanſhip, neceſſarily infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth the praiſe of the workeman, being maker and maſter thereof. Your open praiſing of the one, doth ſecretly praiſe the other. There is no doubt howſoeuer your mouth diſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth it, that your vaine heart doth fooliſhly glorie with the ſot <hi>Damaetas</hi> in the worthy Sidney,

Do you call it truth, to confound ignorantly things different? Do you call it charity, to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the ancient euer receaued truth of all ages and times, by all men allowed and approued as authenticall oracles, and the vnchanged decrees of God and Nature? Obtrude not in this manner the Name of God, of truth, of charity. While you publiſh ſuch abſurd incongruities, erronious paſſages, depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ued principles, crackt and vnſound reaſons, and craſie teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monies, as wildly ouer-runne the face of your whole worke, we will and can eſteeme you no better then a deceiuer, a Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer of men. Thinke not that <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> can be any protection for you in your inſidiation and inſnaring of vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar opinion, with the vain-glorious baites and pretexts of a new learning or revelation, neuer gained before, and now forſooth, infuſed into you alone. It is not vnknowne, that theſe like allectations and intiſements, are vſuall introducti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons vnto common illuſion. There was neuer as yet ſeene fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Heretike, Impoſtor, or Magitian, who was not able with the pollicitations of ſome more then ordinary remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able graces, qualities, or beauties, to vaile and hide his foule acts and intentions, by the excellence of ſome good parts, holding earneſtly and intently mens mindes and fancies, while their eyes therewith dazled, might not eſpie their couert fraudes. If your heart be vpright, let your tongue ſpeake the plaine truth. Truth doth not need her defence by vntruth, by falſe grounds, ſophiſticall reaſon, trifling argumentations, ſuch as you hetherto haue ſolely offered vnto our view. If
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:17643:59"/> you could proue your <hi>Aurum potabile</hi> to be the true <hi>Aurum,</hi> not adulterate, ſpurious, nor ſophiſticate, but indeed the very true genuine ſelfe-ſame preparation, which your grand <hi>Lulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us,</hi> and other Philoſophers haue hunted after (as is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) yet ought you not to make an Idoll thereof, nor lift it vp aboue the nature and confines of an earthly medicine, &amp; ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſe creature. You affirme it heauenly and no humane thing, page 53 of the Latin copie, and page 91. you bid the envious behold the miracles of God therein, ſaying, that the divine hand of God doth worke miraculouſly therein. Thus you ſay in the Latin copie, but in the Engliſh are aſhamed thereof, as doubting leſt the vulgars ſhould hiſſe and point at this your dangerous, ſubtile, cunning, and ſecret inſinuation. Modeſtie rather becommeth truth, then theſe hyperbolicall oſtentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. You cannot excuſe it with your diſtinction of emphati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call termes only, ſince you do not only here, but in all other places, apparently iuſtifie, as properries reall in the nature of <hi>Aurum potabile,</hi> theſe like wonders. And thus far is ſufficient to haue pointed out vnto you your contradictions of your ſelfe, and manifeſt falſehoods in themſelues, which although you may now labour for ſhame of men to hide,
